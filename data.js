It all begins with family.1 Children can achieve and thrive throughout their lives, with the core memories of a happy and fulfilling childhood, and the support of a strong, stable, loving home. This is the experience we want for every child and why this ambitious white paper sits alongside our wider plan to rebuild our public services. This will support children and families at each stage and in every sphere of their lives, so that schools are not alone in working for the brighter future our young people deserve. Our children have the strongest foundations when love and support at home is built on with stretching, enriching and inclusive school experiences. Great schools deliver this for every child. Teachers build children’s knowledge and skills, encouraging debate and discussion, which broadens young people’s horizons and challenges their ideas. They see children’s strengths and where they need extra support, recognising high standards and inclusion as two sides of the same coin. Staff put in place evidence-based strategies that enable children to attend, achieve and thrive at their local school. They deliver support and stretch for every child – from those currently struggling, to those doing well but capable of even more.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_8", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition\t82", "text": "Schools are incredible agents for change: a universal public service that can reach every child and every family. Every school must be set up to match the ambition our children have to face into the world of change, uncertainty and opportunity that lies beyond the school gates.

This white paper is not simply a vision of the change we want to bring to our schools, but a call to parents, schools, local services, and everyone working with children and young people to join us in building a future where every child can achieve and thrive. The challenge we face The last three decades have seen real progress in education, led by dedicated school leaders, teachers and support staff. We have built a new evidence base on what works to improve teaching and learning, from innovative changes such as the implementation of the Rose Review’s findings on phonics, to establishing the evidence base on adaptive teaching to improve classroom practice. But the celebration of such successes must not lead us to the complacent belief that all is well. As childhood has changed and children face both new pressures and new opportunities, education policy has struggled to keep up. Children in reception will go out into a world that is completely reshaped by AI and technology. Young people have wider horizons than ever before, with more agency to find and access information. Yet they have found school doesn’t always meet their horizons. We need to make sure they have strong foundations of knowledge and that they are active participants in their learning – debating, questioning, challenging and pursuing their own inquiry – set up for a lifetime of learning, not passive recipients of information.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_9", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition\t82", "text": "In this world of change, children and young people need to feel a sense of belonging. Yet we have not prioritised this for our young people. Out of 27 European countries, the UK is last in how happy 15-year-olds are with their life.i We want to give children their childhood back. International studies such as PISA show us that high standards of attainment and belonging can go together: countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, South Korea and Japan perform strongly in both.ii,iii We must be every bit as demanding for our children. Yet despite the best efforts of dedicated staff, our school system is not serving all children well. Around one in five children are missing a day of school every fortnight.iv The number of children saying they belong at school has declined.v Teacher and leader turnover is highest in schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils, where children could most benefit from stability.vi,vii Disadvantaged children – especially white working-class2 children – and children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are not succeeding as they should, with too many children not stretched to achieve all they can. Prior to the pandemic, in 2019, the primary school attainment gap widened for the first time since at least 2007, with researchers pointing to the failure to improve attainment for children living in the most persistent disadvantage.viii c Figure 1: Pupil attainment by special educational needs (SEN) and disadvantaged status Source: DfE phonics screening check attainment data, KS2 attainment data, KS4 attainment data * Centre assessed grades ** Teacher assessed grades *** GCSE exams returned in 2022 and grades were awarded at a midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading [Alt text: Line graphs showing lower outcomes for disadvantaged pupils and pupils with special educational needs in each of Year 1, Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4.]", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_10", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition\t82", "text": "Figure 2: Young people’s perceptions of the school environment, 2014-2022 Source: Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) England, 2023 [Alt text: Line graph showing declines in the proportions of children feeling safe in school and feeling as though they belong in school between 2014 and 2022.] Simply continuing the approach we have taken in the past will leave us with an education system that fails too many. That failure is seen in children who move from struggling at school, to not attending or attaining, and go on to become part of the nearly one million young people not in education, employment or training (NEET).ix High quality teaching must be at the heart of our school system. We must double down on evidence-based pedagogy on what works for all children and their learning. And we need to go further, building the evidence on what works for children’s engagement. It is a challenge to us to engage families in the power of education, and to support strong home learning environments alongside schools which excite a love of learning and empower every child.

Our aspiration for every child Transformative change for our country requires bold ambition for our children. Children born under this government will not see their life chances dictated by their background. When this generation finishes secondary school, it is our ambition that: All children will be stretched to achieve higher standards. On average, across the system as a whole, children will leave school achieving a grade 5 or higher across their GCSEs. Every child will share in this improvement – from targeted support to help those furthest behind secure a pass, to ensuring that children who are progressing but capable of more are stretched to achieve the very top grades.

Delivering that ambition centres on schools as an anchor in children’s lives yet stretches far beyond the school gates. It is an ambition that begins with family, and the strong, stable and loving environments that help set our children up for life. It is an ambition that builds on working in partnership with our health service - ensuring that children and families can access services, from maternity and health visiting onward, that enable our children to thrive. It is an ambition that reaches into youth clubs, into sports teams, community groups which shape how children learn to work together in teams, to communicate and respect one another. Schools are the universal public service in children’s lives, but our school staff cannot deliver for children alone. To enable children to achieve in school, government must rebuild public services across our communities – education, local government, health and safeguarding partners – to actively support the healthy, happy childhoods that every parent wants for their child.

Families are the anchors of children’s lives, the circle of love and support that guides young people through the ups and downs of life. But some families are struggling. Parents are searching for support, but too often services have been stripped away.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_22", "section": "Chapter 1: Our children’s futures", "text": "This is having a profound impact on our children. One in four children are arriving at school not fully toilet trained.xvii Higher screen use for young children has been linked to poorer language development.xviii Parents know they have responsibilities, but too often don’t know where to look for support. Council spending on early intervention services, including children’s centres and family support, fell by 42% between 2010/11 and 2023/24, with the most deprived areas hit hardest.xix One in four families with children under five say that they have been unable to access local children’s centres or family hubs, rising to one in three amongst those on low incomes.xx As children grow up there are fewer places in our communities for them to go and to spend time with friends. Between 2010 and 2023, more than 1,000 youth centres closed.xxi Young people associate a lack of opportunities in their communities and spaces to socialise with increasing online interactions.xxii More than a third of secondary school pupils say they do not participate in any enrichment activities in school, and a similar proportion say they do not participate in any activities outside school.xxiii In a typical classroom of thirty children, there are around ten growing up in poverty.xxiv This permeates all aspects of children’s lives and education.

Wrapping services around children and families Across the last year and a half, our first priority has been to fix the foundations of our public services across family support and education systems. Our ambition to rebuild services for children and families comes in two parts: first, to make services available and accessible to families and, second, to join up those services so that information can be shared between them to give children and young people consistent support that fits around their needs. This requires coherent planning of services across a community and an understanding of the patterns of children and families lives in order to design around them. As a government, we are in the foothills of this challenge, but we are beginning to rebuild both the service infrastructure, and the systems of funding, commissioning and accountability that will enable this. This will require schools, trusts, local authorities, and health services to work together in ways that have become unfamiliar over the last decade.

We will consult on a new progress measure to better capture the progress and achievements of children who start secondary school significantly behind their peers. Progress and attainment measures set an expectation that most children should enter at least 8 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications.

More detail on the future role of SENCOs is included in SEND Reform: Putting Children and Young People First. Stronger communication about children’s needs Clear and consistent communication is essential to reforming the SEND system. Families, education settings and professionals need a shared understanding of children’s needs, what support looks like, when it will be delivered, and how it will work across all phases of education. Currently, information about children’s needs is often fragmented across multiple systems, making it harder to keep records accurate and up to date. This can lead to delays in support and gaps during key transitions, such as moving from early years to school or school to college. Parents often report having to retell their story and explain their children’s needs multiple times to different professionals or settings. A responsive, accessible, digital way of recording needs and provision will ensure help is provided quickly and effectively, reducing the risk of challenges escalating and improving continuity of support.

We will support schools to continue to build on existing good practice with more targeted approaches to identify and implement appropriate support to build trusting relationships and support parents to overcome barriers. Our reforms to provision for children with SEND will help schools identify evidence-based approaches for inclusive teaching practices and cultures that will support children’s achievement, attendance and belonging at school. Through our engagement with families and local authorities, we will work to understand the existing support in the system to equip parents for active engagement in their child’s education, including through the provision of parenting programmes. In extreme cases where families consistently fail to engage in cooperating with the school, we will ensure schools understand the powers that exist to mandate engagement where it is lacking. The minimum expectations will also outline the crucial role that families play in children’s learning and wider development, and the expectations of parents and carers in supporting their child to flourish at school. We will include the voice of parents in all our thinking as work develops. In addition to home-to-school partnerships, we will equip families with the tools they need to support their children to develop and learn at home as well as at school. We will work with local authorities and health to better support families, learning from the approaches used in programmes such as Best Start Family Hubs, to provide evidence-based guidance for families about creating effective advice on how to support learning at home and overcoming barriers like access to technology or study space.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_83", "section": "Chapter 4: Withdrawn to engaging", "text": "We will review the current offer for online family support and work with parents and carers to create a one-stop shop of age-appropriate support and advice.

High standards in attendance For many children, poor attendance can be both a symptom and a cause of disengagement in education. Attendance is key to achieving better outcomes, narrowing the disadvantage attainment gap and supporting children with SEND.cli,clii But we are facing significant challenges in attendance, with around 1.5 million children missing a day or more every fortnight at the start of this Parliament.cliii Thanks to the efforts of school staff and parents, we are beginning to see progress, with record improvements in 2024/25 including 140,000 fewer children persistently absent.cliv But there is more to do.

Removing barriers to attendance We are clear that attendance is not optional: parents and carers play a critical role in setting expectations and supporting children to attend, even where there are barriers or a child is not keen to go. It is the responsibility of schools to help children feel engaged and supported - ensuring that school is a place children want to attend and to work with children, parents, local authorities and wider services to help tackle any barriers. Our reform of the SEND system will ensure that schools are equipped to meet all children’s needs and support improved attendance. To drive stronger engagement and ensure it translates into better outcomes, we are rolling out RISE Attendance and Behaviour Hubs. Schools who join the hubs will have access to a structured attendance and behaviour focussed training programme, as well as opportunities to discuss and share effective practice at termly open days. 90 hub schools will bring together regional networks with capacity to support more than 3,000 schools per year. Schools with the biggest challenges will receive intensive support to develop and implement an attendance and behaviour improvement plan focussed on effective systems, data and leadership. Over 500 schools with acute challenges will receive intensive support from a lead school per year, working with them.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_87", "section": "Chapter 4: Withdrawn to engaging", "text": "Case study – Sharing best practice to improve attendance Ninestiles, an Academy, attended the Breaking Down Barriers to Opportunity: Transforming Attendance conference in March, where attendees were encouraged to take a support first approach to absence, working in partnership with families. One key step is a distributional approach to analysing absence data.

That includes investing in their professional development, respecting their expertise and autonomy as professionals. We are also addressing the reasons why many leave the profession, including tackling workload pressures created by high rates of child poverty and a lack of services for children and families around schools. Every child should have expert teachers, leaders and support staff who deliver an enriching education and who set and embody the culture in which all children achieve and thrive. This chapter outlines how we will support, empower and invest in expert leaders, teachers and support staff in every school. Case for change Great teaching is the most important lever schools have for improving children’s attainment, especially for those whose needs have been sidelined for too long - disadvantaged children,clxix those with SEND,clxx and every child who could be pushed further to succeed. Too many teachers report that they lack the confidence to meet the needs of pupils with SEND,clxxi  and teaching children with SEND is the area most commonly mentioned by teachers for further training or development.clxxii Not all children are benefitting from experienced teachers: only around two thirds of teachers are still in service five years after qualifying,clxxiii and many schools struggle to recruit and retain enough teachers. These recruitment and retention challenges are pronounced in certain subjects, including STEM.clxxiv,clxxv Children are missing out on the deep expertise of subject experts, with too many hours taught by non-specialist teachers.clxxvi The gaps in access to high-quality teaching do not fall equally. Schools with higher proportions of disadvantaged children have a greater proportion of unqualified teachers, teachers with 5 years or less experience and higher teacher turnover rates.clxxvii  We must and will do more to address these issues - and ensure all children have access to high quality teaching.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_100", "section": "Chapter 5: Support and investment in high-quality staff", "text": "To improve the school experience for all children, we need the very best school leaders where they are needed most. Leaders want to spend their time focusing on children but are too often hampered from doing so. In 2025, around half of senior leaders said they spent too much time on administration within their school and around three in ten teachers and leaders said they were considering leaving the state-funded school sector in the next 12 months; most cited stress and/or poor wellbeing and high workload as important factors.clxxviii Schools with the highest proportion of children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the highest leaving rates of headteachers.clxxix These schools are the ones that would most benefit from experienced, effective, leadership. An expert teacher in every classroom As a first step to securing the expert teaching that every child needs, we are recruiting 6,500 more teachers. As we set out in our new 6,500 teachers delivery plan, published alongside this white paper, we will work with the sector to drive recruitment and retention across three key themes. Key themes of our 6,500 teachers delivery plan: Attract: optimising routes into teaching, Retain: improving teaching experience and boosting retention, and Develop: expanding career-long development opportunities. We will target shortage subjects, areas that face recruitment challenges, and retention issues.  We are recruiting these teachers where the need is greatest – across our secondary and special schools and FE colleges, where pupil numbers will continue to grow and remain high this Parliament. We have seen good initial progress with over 2,300 more teachers across secondary and special schools in 2024/25,clxxx and 1,150 more new postgraduate trainees in STEM subjects in 2025/26 compared to the previous year.clxxxi This means that the STEM ITT target has been met for the first time since its introduction.clxxxii We are already retaining more of our teachers: the leaver rate has fallen to 9%, the lowest since reporting began in 2010, other than during the COVID pandemic.clxxxiii In a challenging fiscal context, we have already acted quickly to improve the pay of teachers, accepting the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) recommendations for an almost 10% pay award over the last two years and investing £233 million in teacher recruitment for 2025/26. To help promote supportive wellbeing cultures, over 4,200 schools and colleges have already signed up to the Education Staff Wellbeing Charter. We are also providing tools and resources to reduce workload and improve wellbeing, developed by school leaders for school leaders, through the ‘Improve Workload and Wellbeing for School Staff’ service.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_101", "section": "Chapter 5: Support and investment in high-quality staff", "text": "In order to recruit and retain the expert workforce our children need, we will continue our work to reform statutory pay and conditions for teachers and leaders, and will remove the ceiling on pay, giving leaders more flexibility to innovate in what they offer their teachers. We will also go further to address the pressures that staff face. We are investing in a new teacher retention programme from Autumn 2026. This new initiative will build on our flexible working programme, to share best practice across the sector and provide peer support, coaching and resources. This will help schools learn from each other on managing workloads and expanding flexible working, whilst protecting teaching time so that experienced teachers stay and thrive. Assaults on school staff are rare but rising,clxxxiv and totally unacceptable. We will work with the sector to make clear that abuse against teachers will not be tolerated, and to improve reporting of incidents We will work with the sector to support them to ensure more thorough and consistent reporting of incidents so that we can assess the scale of the issue and consider the case for national monitoring or other further action. We will provide new guidance to schools, trusts and local authorities so that staff are better supported where cases of bullying and harassment do take place.

Case Study: EEF – Designing a Modern School Workforce The Education Endowment Foundation has been evaluating the impact of flexible working, with a 2023 review (Flexible working approaches | EEF) finding that while more research is needed in this area, flexible working could have the potential to support recruitment, retention and workforce stability. Challenges to implementing flexible working include potential additional costs and timetabling constraints, but successful flexible working that protects teaching time can be enabled by schools taking a whole-school, proactive approach through effective communication, clear and accessible policies and access to training, tools and guidance.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_102", "section": "Chapter 5: Support and investment in high-quality staff", "text": "One of the innovations the EEF have evaluated is the introduction of a 9-day fortnight for teachers by Dixons Academies Trust.

The EEF is evaluating the 9 day fortnight [Evaluating a nine-day working fortnight as a strategy to… | EEF] and found that delivering the change involved introducing or retaining a fortnightly timetable, increasing specialist teaching at primary level, and flexing some class sizes at secondary. Most teachers reported improved teacher wellbeing, morale, and work-life balance, with no negative impact on children, including those with SEND. Early signs of stronger recruitment and retention were also noted by some school leaders. The 9-day fortnight was a deliberate challenge to the status quo, aimed at giving teachers more control over their time, rather than reducing hours, without impacting teaching hours for children. We lose too many female leaders, teachers and support staff from the profession. Women aged 30-39 are the largest group of leavers from the teacher workforce.clxxxv Maternity pay for staff in education has not kept up with other professions. Therefore, we are taking a first step to address the comparatively low level of maternity pay relative to other parts of the public sector: We will fund schools to improve maternity pay, doubling the period of full pay from the current offer of 4 weeks to 8 weeks for school teachers and leaders from the 2027/28 academic year. Alongside this, we will provide funding for school support staff and will remit the new School Support Staff Negotiating Body (SSSNB) to negotiate an equivalent improvement to maternity pay for support staff in its first year of operation. We will also provide commensurate funding so that colleges can enhance the maternity offer for their staff. Furthermore, we will improve the offer for mothers by improving flexibilities on their return to work after maternity leave. For example, we are taking action to promote and expand flexible working opportunities in schools – our funded flexible working programme offers practical support, including on how flexible working can be navigated alongside career progression.

Standalone schools can chart their own path but can also face serious challenges: of the 55 academy trusts in cumulative deficit as at August 2023, 40 were single-school trusts.cxci Our challenge to our best standalone schools is to partner with others through a school trust, so that they can spread their excellence more widely.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_111", "section": "Chapter 6: Collaboration between schools and with other partners", "text": "Chapter 1: Our children’s futures includes several examples of the need to strengthen local partnership in a system where duties and responsibilities are dispersed between different services. For too long, roles and responsibilities have been unclear, and partnership seen as optional rather than essential. Greater clarity and responsibility within partnerships can unlock better outcomes for children. Collaboration in high quality school trusts Our best school trusts use their scale, governance and high-quality leadership to innovate and drive excellence in standards and inclusion. They can, for instance, bring to life a high-quality curriculum for every child by sharing expertise and resources, and deploy teachers where they are most needed, including to benefit more disadvantaged children,cxcii an approach made easier by operating at scale.  Over time, the performance of secondary schools that have joined trusts has tended to improve.cxciii Resources can be better shared and joint initiatives better implemented, minimising duplication and optimising expenditure. High-quality trusts, rooted in their community, are also well-positioned to collaborate with other schools, local government and health partners, to tackle challenges that extend beyond the school gate to deliver for all children in their area, including those with SEND. We will welcome innovative trusts taking steps to meet the aspirations set out in this white paper, from embedding inclusion to tackling the attainment gap.

This will accelerate improvement across the system, with transformational results for children, by ensuring that schools can be moved from low-performing trusts into suitable and high-performing trusts. We will also explore using existing provisions to require an underperforming trust to strengthen its governance or engage with external support. We want every trust to make the most of its collective strength. Pooling resources effectively can unlock innovation and maximise value for pupils. We will improve arrangements for transparency where resources are being pooled and illustrate where this is being done effectively. By shining a light on great practice and improving transparency for parents and communities, we can support more trusts to operate with the confidence and clarity that characterises the strongest sector practice. We are also clear that the pay of trust chief executives must be justifiable, transparent, evidence-based and reflect individual responsibility. Trustees should adhere to these principles in setting pay, supported by our guidance and advice. However, in some cases, their decisions have led to the agreement of high salaries, compared to peers.

The Plymouth Challenge united city partners under an independent Chair and secondary headteachers, bringing together MAT CEOs, council representatives, Plymouth education networks, and support from the Department and civic leaders. Regular meetings and a shared, place-based strategy enabled the Plymouth Challenge to create clear structures for collective improvement and more coherent regional working. Local leaders also noted that introducing a small number of strong trusts streamlined the system compared with the previous 17 secondary schools across 13 trusts. Following the Challenge, the city has seen steady gains in outcomes relative to the national average, with Attainment 8 now close to the local and national averages, at 45.7 compared to 46.2 across the South West and 46.0 nationally, and outcomes for disadvantaged children improving from over 5 points behind the national average in 2018/19, to within 0.6 points in 2024/25.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_117", "section": "Chapter 6: Collaboration between schools and with other partners", "text": "Our approach will allow for a two-way dialogue and support the sharing of best practice. As the proportion of schools in trusts grows, and it becomes more important for local authorities to lead in convening, commissioning and working with the system to improve educational outcomes, we will engage proactively with Directors of Children’s Services to support the delivery of strategic outcomes, and challenge where this is falling short.

Case study – Practical applications of technology and AI in primary education LEO Academy Trust has embraced AI to enhance learning and streamline teaching. In classrooms, while teachers remain mindful of screen time, children use high quality technology tools to support creative writing, receiving instant feedback and suggestions to improve their work. Teachers employ AI to automate lesson planning and adapt tasks based on individual child needs, saving time and improving inclusivity. The Trust’s use of technology is supporting children with SEND, with children able to access assistive technology when needed. AI also assists in formative assessment by analysing children’s responses and generating tailored next steps, which shows the potential benefits AI (if used correctly) can have on enriching children’s learning experience and reducing teacher workload. Pedagogy is at the heart of how the trust uses technology. The trust makes careful choices about when technology is used and when it is not. Use of technology at the trust has improved staff satisfaction and the trust is consistently above 15-20% above national benchmarks. This is attributed to the reduction in administrative tasks such as lesson scaffolding and resource adaptation.

As school trusts take on a greater role in delivering for children, we will strengthen the accountability system. Trust-level inspection will give parents and communities a transparent view of the quality of leadership, the support it provides, and the outcomes it secures. This sits within a broader shift towards an accountability system that is more intelligent, proportionate and focused on improvement. Implementation: Delivering our ambition for every child We have set out how together we will build a school system that enables all children to achieve and thrive, regardless of their background or need. This is an ambitious vision that will take sustained and determined action over time. We will work with schools and wider partners to enable timely and effective implementation. We have set out a series of asks of schools and other partners - some are new requirements and reforms; others are updates to existing policies. Some are mandatory and others are optional. Schools that are not yet following best practice, or need improvement, may face greater challenges over the next few years. Schools that already provide an excellent, inclusive education, will still need to implement some changes, like the new curriculum, but will also focus on sharing expertise with other schools in their local area and beyond. We are also providing schools with an offer of support. This includes significant financial investment, better, evidence-backed guidance and tools, and help for schools not yet following best practice to learn from others. Providing schools with funding We are investing in schools to deliver these changes. This includes extensive investment in the core schools’ budget, which we have already increased by £3.7 billion in 2025-26 compared to 2024-25. We are adding to this through the additional funding announced in this white paper. We are investing an extra £1.7 billion into schools in 2026-7, meaning the core schools’ budget will total £67.0 billion compared to £65.3 billion in 2025-26.  This will then continue to increase across the Spending Review period - seeing an above real terms per pupil increase in funding.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_131", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition", "text": "This includes significant investment to support mainstream inclusion. From 2026-27 we will provide £1.6 billion for the Inclusive Mainstream Fund so schools, colleges and early years settings funding to deliver an improved inclusion offer, £1.8 billion for Experts at Hand, and a £200 million SEND training programme. This is in addition to £3.7 billion of capital investment from 2025-26. Further details can be found in SEND Reform: Putting Children and Young People First.

Currently, individual schools' actual funding allocations are determined by over 150 local authority funding formulae. Local authorities have moved their funding formula closer to the National Funding Formula in recent years, and the majority of local formulae now mirror the National Funding Formula, and so the move to a direct National Funding Formula is the final step in this direction of travel, delivering a nationally consistent approach. Funding for schools sits alongside significant investment to support children and young people before they enter school and beyond the school gates, as set out in Chapter 1: Our children’s future.

Parents, teachers and young people should never have to choose between academic excellence and inclusion, knowledge and skills, belonging and stretch. We know leaders, teachers and school staff share our aspirations for every child to achieve and thrive. Schools and trusts across the country are already demonstrating what can be achieved when working in partnership. Through this white paper, we set out the steps we will take to harness and spread existing best practice, as well as empowering each part of the system to innovate together to improve outcomes. Delivering this vision will require all of us to work together to get behind our young people’s aspirations - by taking a narrow experience and making it broad, taking children from sidelined to included and supporting children and families from withdrawn to engaged.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_135", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition", "text": "This is our invitation to all those in the sector to work in partnership – both at national level, and in every community across the country. Together, with collaboration and determination, we can enable every child to achieve and thrive. Technical Annex: Our aspiration for every child This annex sets out how progress towards the targets will be measured. Ambition 1: Higher standards for all Progress will be tracked using the national average Attainment 8 (A8) score. The target is to reach an average A8 score of 50, up from 45.9 in 2023/24 and 46.0 in 2024/25.ccv An A8 score of 50 is equivalent to an individual child achieving grade 5 in each GCSE slot (or equivalent level 2 qualification) included in the measure. This is a national ambition, not a school-level target; expectations for individual children and schools will not all be the same. The methodology and qualifications in scope for Attainment 8 and Progress 8 are under consultation following the publication of the government’s response to the Curriculum and Assessment Review.  We will establish a reference group of leading educational research organisations to monitor progress and keep targets consistent as the system evolves. Ambition 2: Halving the Key Stage 4 disadvantage gap The gap will be measured by the difference in national average A8 scores between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged children. At present, disadvantage is defined as children eligible for Free School Meals in the past six years or looked after by a Local Authority (including previously looked after children). The gap was 15.4 points in 2023/24 and 15.5 points in 2024/25.ccvi The target is to reduce this by half, to 7.7 points. Meeting both ambitions – raising the national average A8 to 50 and halving the gap – requires disadvantaged children’s A8 scores to rise by around 10 points in total, roughly one grade higher in each GCSE slot (with English and maths double weighted). If the pupil population remains similar to that in 2024, this equates to around 1.3 million additional grade improvements. Based on current relationships between A8 and English and maths attainment, this also implies over 30,000 more disadvantaged children achieving grade 4+ in GCSE English and maths each year.", "doc": "White Paper"}, {"id": "White Paper_136", "section": "Chapter 7: Enabling innovation and ambition", "text": "The definition of disadvantage is under review, with a view to adopting a household income-based measure in future.  The specific target levels will be reassessed following any change to the definition, but the ambition will remain commensurate with halving the gap. This white paper also sets new targets to improve outcomes sooner: Attendance: Our ambition is to reduce the overall absence rate by 1.3 percentage points – from 7.15% in 2023/24 to 5.85% in 2028/29. This improvement is equivalent to children attending 20 million more days of school each year from 2028/29, representing the fastest improvement in a decade. Progress will be monitored through the School Census and daily attendance data. The 20 million days figure is calculated as: pupil enrolments in 2023/24 × 190 school days × a 1.3-point reduction in absence by 2028/29. Key Stage 2: Our ambition is for the share of children achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths to rise above the 2019 peak (64.9% overall; 51.3% disadvantaged) by the end of this Parliament. Assuming the cohort size remains stable (children now in Year 3) and the disadvantaged rate stays in line with recent years, over 25,000 more children – including 10,000 disadvantaged children – would meet the expected standard than if attainment remained at 2024 levels (60.7% overall; 45.5% disadvantaged).

Every child has a right to an education that is academically challenging, rich in opportunity, and built on strong relationships.  We have a clear objective: children and young people who can achieve and thrive in mainstream education will be supported to do so; and children who need specialist support will receive it promptly and with dignity, clarity and care. We will build an education system where inclusion and high standards are two sides of the same coin. Every child deserves high-quality, inclusive education close to home, where they can learn, make friends, and participate in their community. To make that happen, we want to take the best of the SEND system and make it part of the mainstream so that we have one education system not two parallel ones. Our approach to inclusion is guided by the definition set out by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focussed on breaking down barriers 2. Children’s needs are not fixed. They may change over time, and many will face barriers to learning at different stages of their lives – whether due to poverty, bereavement, caring responsibility or other life circumstances. All staff in truly inclusive settings are able to recognise and respond to a wide range of additional needs, not as a response to specific diagnoses, but as a proactive approach towards creating environments where all children can access learning, feel valued and safe, and succeed. To achieve this, we will:", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_4", "section": "Part five: building an inclusive system together\t135", "text": "strengthen the law to ensure evidence-based support for children and young people is provided early in mainstream settings helping children to stay in education, achieve and thrive alongside their peers; integrate support across health, care, and family services, ensuring children’s  needs are identified and addressed as soon as they emerge; and increase upfront investment so support is readily available for classes and communities of children, rather than locked behind lengthy and bureaucratic individual assessment processes. The evidence is compelling: children and young people learning alongside their peers has proven academic and social benefits for all children3. Pupils with SEND who are educated in inclusive mainstream schools are twice as likely to find employment and live independent lives compared to those with similar needs in special classes4. Learning in their local community gives all children the confidence, resilience, and independence they need to lead fulfilling lives. For children with the most complex needs, special schools provide the right environment for children and young people to make meaningful progress and build independence, but those schools too should be closely connected to the wider system and communities. We are committed to recognising progress and improving outcomes for all children and young people. Our Plan Support for children with SEND starts in their early years. Our reforms will update the SEND Code of Practice and legal requirements for support to be provided in all mainstream education settings from early years to post-16. Our plan to give every child the best start in life will ensure families can access help and support early and locally. Early years providers, working alongside Best Start Family Hubs, play a vital role in identifying needs and intervening swiftly with evidence-based support. We know this works. Evidence shows that children with access to Sure Start Children’s Centres were more likely to have their needs recognised at age 5 and less likely to require SEND support between ages 7 and 165. We have already announced £500 million of investment in Best Start Family Hubs over the next three years, and we will invest over £200 million more for the same period to strengthen the SEND offer in Best Start Family Hubs.

This is a £7 billion cash terms increase on the funding we are providing in 2025-26. In every year of this parliament, core spending on SEND is expected to increase.

We are introducing new duties on settings to create Individual Support Plans and, for the first time, setting out a requirement to use evidence-based tools and interventions to identify and meet need.

There is currently variation in the level of support children with complex needs receive, with no clear or consistent approach to identifying and meeting needs, and too much provision is poorly evidenced. To turn this around, we will introduce new Specialist Provision Packages. Working with experts and shaped through testing with parents, these Packages will be nationally defined, evidence-based packages of support for children and young people which set out exactly what interventions, resources, and standards are required.

We will manage the transition to a new system carefully.

The gap between their GCSE results compared to their peers without SEND has not meaningfully narrowed16 nor has their likelihood of sustaining education, employment, or training after age 16 (figure 1). Too many miss out on high-quality teaching and support because they have unsuitable provision17 limiting progress, confidence, independence, and future life chances. Too often support arrives late and inconsistently18, forcing families to fight for help rather than access the right support early and effectively. Children with SEND are disproportionately likely to be suspended, excluded, or persistently absent, and the gaps with their peers are growing19. And we know SEN identification varies by ethnic group and free school meal eligibility20. The system’s failure to deliver mainstream inclusion in a consistent and widespread way means that fewer children are attending their local school and many travel long distances away from their families and communities21. A greater proportion of the school population is now educated in special schools than at any time in the past half century (see figure 2), more than reversing the progress towards inclusion we saw from the early 1980s, following the seminal Warnock Report. This includes rapidly rising placements in independent special schools, which do not always provide a good quality education, and, as the Education Select Committee has noted: “raises serious questions about […] the extent to which profit motives align with the best interests of children and families”22. This growth in special school places is despite international research finding that inclusion23 can have positive academic and social outcomes for children and young people with SEND, and no, or slightly positive, impacts for those without SEND24.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_11", "section": "Part five: building an inclusive system together\t135", "text": "Analysis we have published shows pupils with SEN taking GCSEs in mainstream schools achieve around half a grade higher in English and Maths than similar pupils in special schools25. This finding is consistent across more than a decade of data (2011-2024). Other evidence suggests more children and young people with SEN could have their needs met in mainstream with the right support26. International evidence highlights that children and young people educated in inclusive settings were almost twice as likely to secure economic independence than similar pupils in special classes27.  And there is evidence increased social inclusion for all children and young people has ongoing positive impacts on life after school, including employment prospects for children and young people with SEND28. Figure 2: State funded special school population as a % of the total school population29 Since the 2014 reforms, the number of children receiving Education, Health, and Care Plans (EHCPs) has doubled (including a 30% increase in children under 5 since 2023)30, after almost two decades of stability31. This rise is mostly due to three types of primary need: Autism Spectrum Disorders; Social, Emotional and Mental Health; and Speech, Language and Communication Needs. The number of children and young people with Profound and Multiple Learning Difficulties and Severe Learning Difficulties – the two needs which are most likely to need to be met in a special school – has remained unchanged (see figure 3). International evidence shows EHCP growth in England has outpaced many comparable European countries32. Comparison with Wales, where increases were roughly half those in England, suggests that around half of the rise reflects wider societal factors, and half reflects features specific to England, such as how the SEND system operates33. Figure 3: Pupils with EHCPs by primary type of need as a percentage of all pupils34 The inability to secure reliable high-quality SEN Support in mainstream has pushed families towards seeking EHCPs as the only mechanism to access support, further shifting the system away from making support available early and a strong universal offer, including ordinarily available provision or early access to multi agency support35. EHCPs were originally designed for the most complex needs but are now used for a broader range of more commonly occurring needs children and young people may face. This is also partly because the effective financial threshold for an EHCP36 for school-aged children, often referred to colloquially as the notional £6k, has been frozen in cash terms since 2013 (a figure itself based on 2009 costs37, resulting in a more than 50% decrease in real terms38) as mainstream school funding became increasingly squeezed. This means some children whose needs were previously met from mainstream school budgets alone are now being partly being met via EHCPs and funded by LAs.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_12", "section": "Part five: building an inclusive system together\t135", "text": "This shift in how support is provided contradicts international evidence suggesting SEND systems that prioritise broader services for a wide group of children rather than funding at individual level tend to be more inclusive and less adversarial39. And inconsistent approaches to identifying and meeting needs lead to widespread variations across settings and communities40. The support provided by EHCPs is also inflexible, making it hard for settings to adapt as needs change over time, which leaves too many children and young people with provision that is not necessarily suitable41. Overall, the current SEND system is ineffective and inefficient. High needs spending has risen very significantly in recent years42 whilst failing to meaningfully improve outcomes, or reduce waiting times to access support from services such as speech and language therapists43, and unsustainable pressure from SEND deficits on local authority budgets. The system will remain unable to meet needs early or effectively unless it changes.

This will start to break the cycle of needs going unmet and getting worse.  Instead, we will intervene proactively, focusing on providing support earlier in children’s lives when this can have the greatest impact. 2. Local. Children and young people with SEND should be able to learn at an education setting close to their home, alongside their peers, rather than travelling long distances from their family and community. Specialist settings should continue to play a vital role supporting those with the most complex needs. 3. Fair. Every education setting should be resourced and able to meet common and predictable needs, including as they change over time, without parents having to fight to get support for their children. Where specialist provision is needed for children and young people, we will ensure it is there, whether that be a mainstream, specialist or Alternative Provision setting, with clear legal requirements and safeguards for children and parents. 4. Effective. Reforms should be grounded in evidence, ensuring all education settings know where to go to find effective practice that has excellent long-term outcomes for children and young people. 5. Shared. Education, health and care services should work in partnership with one another, Best Start Family Hubs, local government, families, teachers, educators, experts and representative bodies to deliver better experiences and outcomes for all our children and young people.

Therefore, we will update the Code to reflect these reforms and respond directly to the findings of recent independent scrutiny. The National Audit Office highlighted the financial instability of the SEND system and the need for wholesystem reform 45. Similarly, the Public Accounts Committee found that the SEND system was at crisis point and recommended that government set out what support children should be able to expect in mainstream settings, alongside strengthening early identification46. The Education Select Committee urged government to strengthen accountability and mandate SEND training for teachers47. Updating the Code will ensure these recommendations are reflected in a clearer, more consistent and more accountable framework for supporting children and young people with SEND.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_23", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "To ensure the revised Code is robust and fully reflects the needs of the sector, we will undertake a separate, full public consultation on the proposed changes, which will launch after the publication of the response to this consultation. This will ensure that children and young people, parents and carers, education professionals, local authorities and health partners and representative organisations are properly consulted, and we will take time to ensure the sector is meaningfully engaged throughout the process. The updated Code will be implemented in line with the wider new system, following consultation, feedback and refinement, so that all stakeholders can prepare effectively for the changes. We will share further details on the Code consultation process following the publication of the response to this consultation. In this update of the Code, we will clarify the responsibilities of education settings and local partners, with a stronger emphasis on an evidence-based support first approach as part of a whole-setting approach to inclusion. Additional professional development and guidance (see page XX) will be made available to educators so that they can better understand common barriers to learning and apply universal strategies to mitigate these in their practice. This will allow them to recognise and respond to a wider range of needs than under the current Code with greater agency and confidence. We will also update the code with refreshed areas of development. The Code currently references four broad areas of need that settings should proactively plan for when designing support for children and young people. These areas of need often face criticism for being poorly defined, with some pointing to underlying needs, while others rely on diagnosis. We hear from teachers and other professionals that the areas of need aren’t useful as currently framed, as they don’t easily bridge into evidence-based strategies for responding to needs in the classroom48. There are also classification errors - such as framing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as primarily a social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) need, even though many of the child or young person’s needs may relate more closely to cognition and learning.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_24", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will refresh these areas of need set out in the Code to better reflect key areas of child development – renaming them ‘areas of development’. In considering how best to do so we have worked closely with our Expert Advisory Group for Inclusion and wider experts 49. These areas must move us away from the categorisation of children and an increasing reliance on diagnosis, which may hide nuance and individual difference in barriers to learning and participation. Instead, the areas of development will support early and dynamic needs-led provision, enabling educators to recognise and respond to the educational needs that are likely to present in a classroom or setting, described in terms that they know and understand. They should provide an organising framework around which educators can structure and build their knowledge of actions that they can take in the classroom or setting to support a child to progress. Through resources provided in the National Inclusion Standards and effective continual professional development, educators will understand more about the areas of development and will be able to use their knowledge to identify barriers to learning or participation when they notice that a child or young person is struggling to participate or make progress. The National Inclusion Standards will help them decide on high-quality strategies to support them. We propose that the new areas of development should be: Executive Function; Motor and Physical; Sensory; Speech, Language and Communication; Social and Emotional. An initial summary definition for each area has been included in Annex D, and we will continue to work with experts to refine the definitions of each of the areas, to be included in the updated Code of Practice and underpinning the National Inclusion Standards.

Therefore, we think there is merit in clearly setting out what all schools should do to support a child with mental health needs, whether or not that child also has identified SEND. Schools will concentrate on creating calm, inclusive environments, building belonging, and making reasonable adjustments. For some children, their mental health need will be their only additional need. For others, school-led support for their social and emotional needs may need to be delivered alongside clinical mental health interventions, which should be led by health professionals. The proposed change to the labelling of this area will bring social, emotional and mental health in line with the other areas of development, which do not include areas that lend themselves to specific clinical intervention. It will bring clarity to support effective collaboration and appropriate boundaries between what educators should lead and respond to and where support should be led by health professionals, with the collaboration of schools, as with other medical and clinical issues such as epilepsy or diabetes. Clinical mental health interventions, which should remain with health professionals, are likely to play a significant role in some of the Specialist Provision Packages and we expect that the independent expert panel will consider the mental health input required in each of these Packages.

Free text (250-word limit) Data and technology “Assistive technology should be standard.” -  National Conversation online portal, 2025 Effective use of technology and data, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), can make a real difference in improving educational outcomes. Safety is critical - any digital tools that we use must be backed by strong evidence and work in real situations to improve the education of all children and young people. AI is moving fast, and some settings are already showing how it can help - not through crude uses that make things easier at the expense of children developing essential cognitive skills, but by using good educational understanding to improve learning for every child and young person, reduce teacher workload, and make systems run more efficiently. In the future, we want to create a digital, datadriven system that actively supports children and young people with SEND and their families, making education more inclusive. To support this approach, we have already started carrying out user-centred research with education settings, local authorities, parents and professionals, to increase our understanding of how information on SEND is currently recorded and shared. This has highlighted particular challenges with tracking early concerns and use of disparate systems that information cannot be shared easily between, which is especially problematic at transition points. As we develop this digital approach, we will learn from schools, families and practitioners to design tools that strengthen practice where it already works well, add value where it is most needed, and avoid introducing unnecessary bureaucracy.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_27", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will use these insights to develop digital solutions, including Individual Support Plans (page XX), that address these challenges and build on best practice. At the same time, we will also enable innovation and ensure that any technology works hand in hand with education to help every child achieve and thrive. To support this, we will invest in research and development to improve tools for early identification, ensuring they are accurate, ethical, actionable, and integrated with our wider digital offer. We are also aware of a proliferation of tools marketed to schools that claim to support the identification of needs or to ‘screen’ for certain conditions. Where teachers and educators use additional tools, these must be robustly evaluated, evidence-based and lead to proven interventions. Evidence also suggests that assistive technology, when implemented well, can support children and young people with SEND to access learning and develop independence, particularly for those with sensory and physical needs50. Excellent teachers and educators are already embedding these tools within their inclusive professional practice, building on what works with evidence-based strategies rather than replacing them at the first sign of additional need51. There is also strong evidence for the benefits of communication devices that help non-verbal children and young people express themselves52. However, the impact of assistive technology varies by context and type of need, and effective use depends on staff confidence and training. That is why we are investing in practical support to help settings make informed decisions and use technology effectively. Case study 3: Effective assessment and monitoring tools The Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI) is a 20-week programme that supports children’s vocabulary and listening skills through targeted group and individual sessions. It also helps identify early language difficulties. The programme uses LanguageScreen, a digital assessment tool that supports teachers to select children who would benefit and track their progress. In the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) effectiveness trial of NELI, children who took part in NELI made the equivalent of four additional months’ progress in language skills, on average, compared to children who did not take part53.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_28", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "At Yewstock School a special school in rural Dorset, both NELI and LanguageScreen have shown strong positive impacts. NELI sessions are delivered outside the classroom in small groups or individually and can be run by trained teaching assistants. Yewstock has reported outstanding pupil progress, particularly on confidence levels, with higher engagement in lessons and group activities. LanguageScreen has also helped the school and Speech and Language Therapists more easily monitor needs and identify any additional support beyond the programme. We are already piloting Assistive Technology Lending Libraries with local authorities, enabling up to 3,800 mainstream settings in participating areas to borrow and trial assistive technology on a temporary basis. Backed by £1.6 million of funding this year, this pilot will allow settings to make informed decisions and identify products that could make an impact for children and young people with more specific needs. This year, we will also make high-quality online training content available nationally to help teachers and educators use assistive technology effectively to support children and young people with SEND. These evidence-based support materials will be free to access for all educators, helping settings make the most of assistive technology. Taken together, these initiatives will build staff confidence in choosing and using technology, so children and young people with SEND can access the curriculum more fully, develop independence, and thrive in mainstream education. Support for children and families in the earliest years of life “We shouldn’t wait for a crisis to act – support should be the default, not the exception.” – National Conversation engagement event participant Families need access to education, health and care support that is coordinated, timely, and rooted in their local community. For far too long, the early years have been regarded as an optional add-on rather than an integral part of the education system. In the Schools White Paper and our SEND reforms, we are clear that the early years are fundamental to securing positive long-term outcomes for all children, and especially those with SEND.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_29", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "There is strong evidence that early identification and support for children’s developmental needs lead to better developmental, educational and social outcomes. The earliest years of a child’s life are crucial: this is when cognitive development is at its most rapid, and when the right support can make the greatest and most lasting difference. Acting early prevents learning gaps from becoming entrenched and reduces the need for later intensive SEND provision. Evidence from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that children with access to Sure Start Children’s Centres were more likely to have their needs recognised at age 5 and less likely to require SEND support between ages 7 and 1654. Wider evidence reinforces the importance of early identification; timely recognition of needs helps ensure children receive the right interventions and can support positive outcomes55. Early identification and timely intervention improve developmental and educational outcomes across a wide range of SEND. Evidence shows that early intervention is more effective than later intervention for some needs – including the fastest-growing areas of need amongst reception-age children – Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN), Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Social, Emotional and Mental Health needs 56. Early intervention for SLCN capitalises on the rapid cognitive development occurring during children’s early years, and there is strong evidence that early support for emotional regulation, social communication and behaviour reduces escalation into more complex needs57. To truly reform our SEND system and ensure children receive help early and effectively, support must reach families in their child’s earliest years in ways that are joined up, local and responsive. Best Start Family Hubs and early years settings sit at the heart of this approach. Best Start Family Hubs, childminders, maintained nursery schools, school-based nurseries and private, voluntary and independent providers will all work with families, health professionals and education experts to understand and meet children’s needs from the earliest point, supporting them to thrive. Early years educators across all settings will be able to access high-quality professional development through the national training programme (page xx), building the skills and confidence to support children effectively.  All early years settings and Best Start Family Hubs will have access to evidence-based identification and intervention tools through the National Inclusion Standards (page xx). This builds on the commitment we made in our Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life strategy to double the number of Early Years Stronger Practice Hubs from 18 to 36, enabling more early years settings to access free, evidence-based resources and training. Furthermore, all settings will be able to draw on specialist expertise through the new Experts at Hand offer (page xxx), addressing the inconsistent and limited access many settings experience today.

While we recognise the value of diagnosis, educational support should not be dependent on it – and this was never the intent of the 2014 Children and Families Act. Without clarity on what good inclusive practice looks like for children with additional needs, support is inconsistent across settings and regions. To change this, we must empower education professionals with clear, evidence-based guidance and practical tools, so that they can adopt inclusive whole-setting approaches and strategies and recognise and respond to barriers to learning and participation early. By 2028, we will have invested up to £15 million to build the evidence base for, and then provide, National Inclusion Standards. These will comprise of a digital library of high-quality identification tools and provision across the 0-25 system covering all layers of support and making clear what good ordinarily provision should be in every setting. It will be the go-to place for educators to understand the latest evidence-based approaches to universal, whole-setting strategies, targeted interventions, and identifying and responding to barriers to learning.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_33", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will ensure the National Inclusion Standards are informed by evidence, with close multi-agency work with experts, as well as children, young people and their families.

Free text (250-word limit) Reasonable adjustments Don’t overdo not a diagnosis Our approach to inclusion is guided by the definition set out by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focussed on breaking down barriers. Children’s needs are not fixed. They may change over time, and many will face barriers to learning at different stages of their lives – whether due to poverty, bereavement, caring responsibility or other life circumstances. Truly inclusive settings are able to recognise and respond to a wide range of additional needs, not as a response to specific diagnoses, but as a proactive approach towards creating environments where all children can access learning, feel valued and safe, and succeed. Many children and young people with SEND will have a disability under the definition set out in the Equality Act 2010. This definition does not require a formal diagnosis, only that “a physical or mental impairment has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ negative effect” on the ability to do normal daily activities. This offers statutory protection, requiring settings to make reasonable adjustments so that disabled children and young people do not face substantial disadvantage. Settings should therefore consider reasonable adjustments based on any needs a child or person may have that meet this definition of disability, without the requirement for a formal diagnosis.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_34", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will produce practical guidance on reasonable adjustments, which will contain real examples and simple, actionable tools to embed inclusive practice confidently and consistently. There is already a range of guidance for settings to help them think in advance about what adjustments might need to be made for disabled children and young people, and how to make adjustments in individual circumstances. Our new guidance will make clear that children do not need a diagnosis to receive reasonable adjustments and help settings consider how some disabilities can be addressed at a universal level - both through high quality teaching, and through wider aspects of school or setting policy such as uniform, behaviour and classroom management. We will also consult with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and education partners in producing this guidance, and ask the EHRC to ensure the important role of reasonable adjustments for children with disabilities in schools and other educational settings is reflected in their Technical Guidance for Schools.

National training Mandatory “Training should be practical, not just theory – we need strategies we can use tomorrow.” – National conversation engagement event participant. High-quality teaching is the biggest factor in helping every child achieve and thrive58. We know that strong teaching from the start of children’s education can boost their learning, social skills and future opportunities59. We want all children and young people to access a high-quality curriculum and be well taught by their teachers. However, too many teachers and educators say they do not feel confident teaching children with SEND, or that they do not have the right knowledge and skills60 or expertise61. This can make it challenging for families to find early years places for children with SEND, and for children to get the support that they deserve. As is made clear by the Institute of Fiscal Studies62 and others, to build an inclusive system, we need to equip teachers and educators from early years through to post-16 with the right tools and training to meet a broad range of needs in the classroom.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_35", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "To address this, we are launching a new landmark training package on inclusion, with an investment of over £200 million over three years. This means that from September 2026, all staff nationwide will benefit from new training across early years, schools, and colleges, supported by government backed training materials developed with experts. At every phase, staff will be supported to engage with parents and develop skills in building inclusive learning environments and spotting needs early so that children receive timely support. For early years educators, training will also focus on inclusive pedagogy, child development, and practical strategies for supporting all children, building on the commitments made in the Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life strategy and ensuring every setting feels confident in welcoming children with SEND. For staff in schools, training will focus on adaptive teaching and creating calm classrooms to provide the best support for their pupils.

In Further Education, teachers will build on best practice to ensure learning is accessible for all, supporting our wider ambitions to establish a coherent, career-long professional development Package, as set out in the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper. This new inclusion training offer builds on improvements to existing programmes, such as the new Initial Teacher Training and Early Career Framework, which contains significantly more content on adaptive teaching and supporting children and young people with SEND. We have also strengthened requirements on providers to ensure materials for early career teachers contain clear guidance on SEND, and will review this again in 2027 to ensure they continue to reflect the latest evidence. Alongside this, a review of our National Professional Qualifications is underway to consider how we can further improve leadership of SEND and inclusion across the frameworks. We have also committed to review the Early Career Teacher Entitlement in 2027, with a focus on teaching children and young people with SEND, building on the improved offer that began in September 2025. We will consult with the early years sector on teacher training routes and course content; this will inform training in inclusive practice for early years teachers.

Specific material from this programme will then be available to access alongside further best practice and evidence. There will be a new requirement set out in the SEND Code of Practice for all settings to ensure that staff receive training on SEND and inclusion, and to clearly signpost government funded training. By embedding this expectation across early years, schools and colleges, we will upskill staff and promote inclusive practice. Leaders will retain flexibility to select training that fits their context, while guidance and signposting will support quality and consistency.

This chapter is split into Targeted support (set out below) and Targeted Plus support (see page XX). The key difference is that Targeted support covers commonly occurring needs that every mainstream setting should be familiar with and able to reasonably respond to; Targeted Plus support covers less commonly occurring needs, that require mainstream settings to work together with local government and health partners to provide support from education and health professionals. Targeted Support Targeted support provides structured interventions within mainstream settings – such as small group work or personalised materials – recorded in an Individual Support Plan that moves with the child or young person across the layers of support.

Families, settings, and professionals need to share a clear understanding of what high quality evidence-based support for different needs looks like, and when and how it will be delivered, across each phase of education. Many settings already keep records of the needs and provision required by their children or young people with SEND. However, often these records are spread across different places or repeated in several systems, which makes it harder to keep everything accurate and current, and sometimes means more time is spent managing paperwork than focusing on children’s needs. It also prevents effective sharing of information at key transition points – such as when children move from an early years setting to a school, or from a school to a college – which can lead to a gap in support. A consistent, responsive and digital way of recording special educational needs and provision will make sure help is provided quickly and effectively, and is able to keep up with a child or young person’s development, preventing challenges from escalating and reducing the risk of disengaging from learning. We will place a duty on schools (including maintained nursery schools and school-based nurseries) and colleges to produce an ‘Individual Support Plan (ISP) for any child or young person with SEND. We will consider, through future consultation, how an equivalent duty could be extended to private, voluntary and independent early years providers. The ISP will be tailored in line with the layers of support, with guidance to support settings in creating high quality plans. We will set out the information that the ISP must include, such as the child or young person’s identified barriers to learning, their provision, any reasonable adjustments and intended outcomes, including that this must be developed with parents. ISPs will be standardised across the system to facilitate transitions between settings. For children receiving Targeted support, ISPs should include evidence-based interventions from the National Inclusion Standards (page XX). They will then be used to communicate provision to parents and actions taken between parents and settings supporting the relationship between home and setting. This will help parents to work collaboratively with settings and enable them to take an active role in supporting their child’s educational progress.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_39", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "ISPs will be interactive, accessible and available in a digital format, supporting consistency across the system. This work sits alongside the approach outlined in the ‘Data and Technology’ section (page XX) to bring together a digital system which is both data driven and actively supports children and young people with SEND and their families. We recognise that any digital approach must integrate with wider services.  A child or young person’s ISP will therefore be a living product, updated to reflect changes in a child or young person’s barriers to learning or the provision put in place for them. This approach will help provision to remain responsive and effective throughout a child’s education, as well as facilitating transitions between early years, schools and post-16 providers and reassuring parents that their child’s needs will be recognised, recorded and supported. This digital approach will be primarily designed for children and young people with SEND, though its use and functionality could be expanded in future. The duty to produce an ISP will come into effect following changes to legislation, and we will set a requirement for ISPs to be reviewed annually at a minimum, and be discussed with parents and young people. The use and quality of ISPs will be assessed through Ofsted’s inspections and assessment of SEND provision at a setting level. Where there are concerns about provision, parents and young people will be able to resolve this directly with the setting, including making use of the improved schools complaints process as set out on page XX. We recognise that SEN support has not always worked well for children, and parents feel their knowledge or concerns about their children have not been listened to. We will work with parent groups, sector experts and workforce colleagues to explore options for how experts within the system can provide assurance around the creation and delivery of ISPs. We will develop options that ensure ISPs are high quality and that support is being effectively delivered, especially during the transition period. This could include options for peer review of ISPs at group level, expert recommendations for appropriate content from the National Inclusion Standards (page XX) at Targeted Plus (page XX), or a role for sector delivery experts to audit and assure the delivery of Targeted support in mainstream settings.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_40", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Q14.

This is following recommendations for reform set out in the Curriculum and Assessment review. The Post 16 Education and Skills White Paper also sets out our commitment to ensure that every learner has access to high-quality Packages with a clear line of sight to employment or further study.  This will include new Packages at Level 2, new English and maths stepping-stone qualifications at Level 1 to provide a gradual route for learners with low prior attainment before resitting GCSEs where appropriate, and reformed vocational qualifications at Level 3 (V levels). We will also ensure disability is taught in the curriculum, so that all children and young people have a positive, and informed understanding of disability. We also support the recommendation to develop evidence-led resources to support curriculum adaptation for all children and young people, including those with SEND. We will work in collaboration with experts and school leaders to create new Curriculum in Practice resources: a flexible suite of adaptive teaching strategies, case studies and real-world examples tailored to different phases of education. In addition, Oak National Academy will continue to design digital resources that are easily adaptable by teachers to meet the specific needs of their pupils, including those with SEND. For special schools and alternative provision, we recognise there is an important role for these schools in providing an appropriate curriculum for their children, and we will continue to explore this with them.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_41", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will work with experts to look at the curriculum in special schools, and mainstream curriculum adaptions and flexibility. Throughout the National Conversation, school leaders made clear that they wanted more support and to learn from best practice at special schools. Special schools also said they would welcome national best practice and guidelines, where they are currently developing their own curriculum. This approach will ensure that children are taught a high-quality curriculum offer, whichever setting they attend. Following the Curriculum and Assessment Review, we will set out how pupils with an Individual Support Plan receiving targeted plus support or in the specialist layer of support with an Education, Health and Care Plan can benefit from more flexibility and adaptations in the teaching of the national curriculum. Transitions between early years, schools and colleges “Shared documentation would also support smoother transitions between early years, school and college.” – Parent, National Conversation online portal, 2026 Transitions between stages of education can be challenging for all children and young people, but especially for those with SEND and their families. These moments of change often bring uncertainty, and without the right support, they can affect progress and confidence. We are committed to making these transitions smoother and more supportive, so every child and young person, whatever the support they require, feels prepared and able to thrive as they move into the next phase of learning or into employment. An Individual Support Plan (page XX) will ensure that key information about a child or young person’s needs is available for their next setting stage of education. This will enable staff to put timely, appropriate support in place from the beginning, therefore minimising the risk of known challenges resurfacing as the child or young person progresses. In Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life, we committed to funding new partnerships to strengthen transitions between early years settings and schools, with a particular focus on children with SEND and additional needs. These partnerships will allow staff to learn from one another and share effective practice, supported by the National Inclusion Standards (page xx), which will provide consistent, evidence-based guidance on what works. They will also help parents and children build relationships with schools, and help teachers prepare to meet individual needs so that children feel settled and confident when they start school. We will also publish and share best practice from schools that effectively support children’s transition into reception. This will complement wider initiatives to boost quality in the reception year, including new Reception Networks, new training for reception classroom teachers, and continued funding for targeted programmes, such as the Nuffield Early Language Intervention programme.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_42", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will work with schools, colleges and local authorities to design and implement a clear approach to support transition from school to college. In terms of sustaining a post-16 destination, the gap between those with SEN compared to those without has risen over the past four years, to 8.1 percentage points (84.4% vs 92.5%)64 but we also know that young people with SEND are 80% more likely to be not in education, employment or training (NEET) than the average of their peers65. To reduce the risk of young people with SEND becoming NEET, planning for transition needs to begin at least 12 months in advance. This will allow post-16 providers, in partnership with schools and local authorities, to create bespoke or cohort-based transition packages for students with SEND. In doing so, they will ensure young people can choose a suitable study programme and are supported from day one through to further education. We will work to embed best practice on transition planning across all schools and colleges and holding them to account for this. Our commitment in the Skills White Paper to improve careers guidance and deliver two weeks work of work experience for all young people during their secondary schooling will help ensure that young people with SEND receive the support they need to navigate their options and progress into further education and/or employment. This builds on commitments in the Post-16 Education and Skills White Paper to reduce the numbers of young people becoming NEET through better identification of risk, improved data sharing, and ensuring each young person has a planned destination before they leave school. We are working across government to ensure that transition to higher education (HE), training or employment is as smooth as possible for young people with SEND. For example, a Test, Learn and Grow programme will focus on transitions into adulthood for young people with SEND in Sandwell and Nottingham (and their combined authorities), and the Youth Guarantee Trailblazers are trialling interventions to strengthen transitions for young people at risk of becoming NEET. We recognise that some young people, including those without EHCPs, need more time to complete their studies. The 16–19 funding system already enables all students who need to continue studying at age 18 to do so, including those starting twoyear courses and those with EHCPs will continue to be supported where needed up to the age of 25. We will also consider whether further support is needed for young people with SEND who do not have an EHCP under the new system after the age of 18. We also welcome the independent report into Young People and Work Authored by The Rt Hon Alan Milburn, due to conclude by Summer 2026, which will make recommendations aimed at increasing opportunities for young people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_43", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Apprenticeships will continue to offer a valuable route into employment, with additional support available to help employers take on young people with SEND, alongside new opportunities through Foundation Apprenticeships. Supported Internships will remain a proven Package to employment for young people furthest from the labour market, with thousands of high-quality opportunities now available across the country with a range of employers following significant investment.  We have also seen positive outcomes from our pilot extending Supported Internships to young people without Education, Health and Care Plans and we intend to continue this pilot for at least a further year.

Supporting young people with SEND as they move into HE is essential to ensuring they can settle well and thrive at university or in other HE settings. Although the 0–25 SEND system does not formally extend into HE, providers have clear duties under the Equality Act 2010 to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and support disabled students effectively. The Disabled Students Commission, established and funded by the Office for Students, offers important guidance and insights to help HE providers understand their responsibilities, share best practice, and put in place strong, inclusive support. In addition, the Disabled Students Allowance  also provides funding for reasonable adjustments that sit outside the statutory school and college framework, ensuring students can access the support they need to succeed.

Inclusion Bases “Local should mean local – not two hours on a bus.” - National Conversation engagement event participant Our £3.7 billion high needs capital investment between 2025 and 2030, aims to improve the accessibility of buildings, create new special school places, and create tens of thousands of new places in Inclusion Bases in mainstream settings. We want early years settings, schools and colleges to be able to develop strong specialist support, expanding on good practice in SEN units, resourced provision, and pupil support units. This means we will create tens of thousands of places in mainstream settings, delivering the right support for children and young people that need it. This expansion is reflected in the Education Estates Strategy published earlier this year, supporting an estate that is suitable to meet the need of children and young people with SEND, increase local capacity, and allow significantly more children to benefit from this provision. Many settings will already have a space where they deliver additional support, catch-up interventions, and small group work.  These spaces will still exist and are an essential part of a setting’s day to day approach to flexibly support children with additional needs. We will replace the current terms SEN unit, resourced provision, and pupil support unit (sometimes referred to by settings as ‘internal alternative provision’) to make it easier for parents to understand the support available for their child.

In time, we expect every secondary school will have an inclusion base, with an equivalent number of places in local primary schools. For many settings, where high quality support is already being provided, it will be a continuation of best practice we see across the country. For some, this will be using the provision they have in a different way; and where there is a need to create new places, including by repurposing and improving existing space, this can be supported by our capital investment. This will allow children to continue to access the provision that's right for them as they transition. Embedded within mainstream settings, bases will offer bespoke learning environments and flexible access to specialist education or health support where needed, helping children thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.

Specialist knowledge flows outwards from these bases into all classrooms. They will be a source of expertise for teachers, educators and leaders – a place informed by specialist insight and where practice is strengthened.

Educational Psychologists and Speech and Language therapists We will grow the workforce of educational psychologists and speech and language therapists for children and young people to access support sooner. This will be backed by an investment of over £40 million and includes training over 200 more educational psychologists per year from 2026 and investing in the Speech and Language therapy workforce over the next three years. We have heard that too often children and young people with SEND wait far too long to receive support from specialist health and education professionals, such as educational psychologists and speech and language therapists (SaLTs). Speech, language and communication needs are the most prevalent primary need for children and young people with SEND74, and these skills are a key indicator of school readiness and future life outcomes. Despite this, speech and language therapy has the secondhighest waiting lists in children’s community services. As of November 2025, NHS England’s community waitingtime data shows that more than 64,000 children and young people were waiting to see a SaLT.75 Similar shortages affect educational psychology: 88% of local authority principal educational psychologists reported difficulties in recruiting staff76, and 19% of teachers who needed support from an educational psychologist said they were never able to access it77.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_53", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We are therefore investing £40 million over three years to boost the educational psychology and speech and language therapy workforce. We will grow the educational psychologist workforce by investing in training over 200 more educational psychologists per year from 2026 and 2027, with further investment to train more over the following three years. This builds on the £31 million the government has already invested to train 600 additional educational psychologists since 2023. By strengthening the workforce and streamlining the statutory assessment process (see Part 4), we aim to reduce the amount of professional time spent on paperwork. Research estimates7817 hours on one EHCP￼ and 79 capacity because statutory assessments take up so much of their time￼. Our reforms will enable them instead to focus on early identification, intervention, and direct support for children and young people, aligning with findings from the Workforce Insights report, which shows that 8081educational 82 are unable to use the full range of their skills due to high volumes of statutory assessments83.

There will always be a choice for children and young people to attend a local mainstream school. However, we recognise that for children and young people with the most complex needs, highly specialised provision is required, beyond that which can be accessed in the universal and targeted layers. The Specialist layer will provide this support, in both specialist and mainstream settings, based on nationally defined Specialist Provision Packages. These Packages will form the basis of an EHCP which will outline the evidence-based educational support required by the child or young person. In this document, we refer to children and young people who need the Specialist layer of support as having ‘complex needs’. We have not provided a singular definition of this term and recognise that this language can be interpreted in different ways. One organisation has defined ‘complex needs’ in the following language: A child with complex needs has a combination of multiple overlapping and long-term conditions or a single condition that significantly impacts many aspects of daily life and sometimes life expectancy. These children often, but not always, have a range of support needs spanning physical, cognitive, communication, sensory and mental health. Children with complex needs often, but not always, need support from health, education, and social care84. Delete indented reference to complex needs We have outlined below our proposal for setting out the support to be made available via the Specialist Provision Packages, and we intend for each of these to include a description of the presenting need profile it is designed to support. We are committed to engaging with parents and families and disabled children’s organisations, as well as wider sector experts and the independent expert review panel to ensure that we capture all of the children and young people who will need such support within the overall range of Specialist Provision Packages. These descriptions will collectively define ‘complex needs’ going forward.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_55", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "As outlined in Part One, we propose moving to a continuum of support where all children and young people with SEND will have an Individual Support Plan, which includes evidence-based provision drawn from the National Inclusion Standards and is managed by their setting. This model means support begins with the universal offer, including, for example, high-quality adaptive teaching, moving through the targeted layer with targeted support, such as small group provision, and targeted plus support such as interventions from a speech and language therapist. This provision will largely be small interventions which will be in addition to the standard education offer. For children with the most complex needs, a more distinct offer, which is substantially different from the usual curriculum model and approach delivered in mainstream settings, will provide comprehensive packages of support, in the specialist layer.  These packages will cover the full offer the child or young person requires, including core educational provision where this is different from the norm, and the range of additional services, intervention and resources that are needed to remove their barriers to learning such as access to physiotherapy, augmentative communication devices. These packages of support will be known as Specialist Provision Packages and will underpin the provision set out in an EHCP. The proportion of school children with an EHCP is currently 5.3%. We project this to rise further by 2029/30, with the proportion of school age pupils needing a Specialist Provision Package, and hence EHCP, returning to around 5.5% by 2035, and above the long-term historical trend, given what we know about international patterns of need. Specialist Provision Packages Add stronger language: developed with families At present, there is a lack of clarity, consistency and, in some cases, quality in the provision made for children and young people with similar complex needs. This lack of consistency and agreement in how needs should be identified and met contributes to widespread variations across settings85, making it harder for settings to promptly adapt as needs change over time, and leaving too many children and young people with provision that does not always reflect their current needs86. Variation at the setting level is compounded by differences in how local authorities assess children and young people for an EHCP, and what provision is included within each individual plan.

This will enable a rapid response when needs change and ensure that approaches reflect the latest evidence on what works, and ensure children and young people get the support they need, and this does not rely on a parent’s ability to navigate the system, including by paying for private assessments90. We will work to ensure the overall time it takes to agree an EHCP is reduced. Therefore, we propose the following changes: EHCPs will be developed with the setting, and in consultation with parents, after the Specialist Provision Package and placement decisions have been made, rather than beforehand, as happens now.  They will include the educational offer based on the relevant Package, as well as health and care provision agreed during the assessment process The setting will have the legal duty to deliver the educational offer in an EHCP ISPs (see page 51 ) will set out the individually tailored day to day provision, and progress towards outcomes, which each child or young person will receive Local authorities (LAs) will retain overall ownership of an EHCP and their duties to provide sufficient placements and resources will be strengthened. If a child or young person is assessed as not requiring an ECHP, then the local authority will be expected to work with the school to ensure appropriate support is put in place We will strengthen the needs assessment process so it is clearer, simpler, and reflects the voice of parents/carers and the child or young person. The local authority will coordinate the assessment process, which will include input from any experts who have supported the child or young person to date, and the responsible health commissioner will be required to identify and secure the relevant health provision required by the child or young person", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_61", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We will look to introduce a standardised and digitised EHCP template, transferable across settings and LAs, this will improve quality and consistency and be complemented by the NHS’s move towards digital-first service delivery An improved review process, so day to day provision in an ISP is reviewed regularly by the setting and the EHCP is reviewed at the end of key stages by LAs, who will ensure they bring in the right expertise and knowledge from experts.

Sitting alongside their EHCP, their secondary school or college will produce an ISP detailing the day-to-day educational support they will receive.  If they do not, then the LA and setting will work together to move their support to an ISP in a mainstream setting, and for them to access provision in the universal and targeted layers once their EHCP has ceased. We anticipate that each year during the transition fewer than half of all children and young people with an EHCP in relevant year groups (i.e. reaching the end of a school phase) will transition to an ISP [and their EHCP will cease] in time for the start of the next school year.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_66", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "The first cohort of children and young people to transition will be those in year 6, year 11 and year 13 in 2029/30. They will be assessed from September 2029 and move to the new system in September 2030. If, after they have been assessed, they are due to move to an ISP rather than a Specialist Provision Package and a new  EHCP, they will still keep their current EHCP and support until the end of the 2029/30 academic year. All children and young people – not just those in this first cohort  -who move from an EHCP to an ISP will  retain the ability to request a placement at a mainstream setting of their choice. We expect the final cohort to transition to the new system in 2035. All children and young people who have a special school place in September 2029 will be able to stay in special school until the end of their education, unless they chose to move to move to mainstream setting. The specialist sector “How can we tap into the incredible wealth of expertise in the specialist sector to support the increase in inclusion in mainstream - is there a plan for this?” – National Conversation online event, January 2026 The specialist sector comprises a wide range of settings including maintained special schools, non-maintained special schools, independent special schools (ISS), special academies, Alternative Provision (AP) schools, special post-16 institutions. The vision in this section applies to all these settings but there are some reforms specific to ISS and AP settings that are included in the two subsequent sections. In the early years, specialist provision looks different because of the nature of children’s needs and the diversity of settings. Specialist provision can be delivered in a range of settings, including specialist early years settings which play an important role in the early years SEND system. While children in the early years will have access to Specialist Provision Packages, as there is no separate statutory early years specialist sector not all reforms set out in this chapter apply in the same way, and much of how these settings operate, the cohorts they support, and how provision is arranged will continue to be determined locally.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_67", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "These reforms represent a fundamental reset for the specialist sector, clarifying its key role supporting children and young people with the most complex needs with a consistent and evidence-led offer.  The proportion of school children in a specialist placement is currently 2.4% and is expected to rise further by 29/30. By 2035, we expect that 3.1% of school children will be in a specialist placement – including specialist bases within mainstream schools.  For the first time, specialist provision will be underpinned by clear evidence-based Specialist Provision Packages, and expertise will be harnessed not only for those in specialist settings but shared across the whole education system. This is a shift towards greater integration: specialist settings will become centres of excellence, driving inclusive practice through outreach and partnership with mainstream settings. With stable, predictable funding and stronger accountability, the sector will have the confidence to innovate and invest in high-quality provision, while families gain clarity and trust that support will be consistent, fair, and focused on outcomes. These changes will elevate the role of specialist settings, so they are a vital, collaborative force at the heart of an inclusive education system. A key part of reform will therefore be to strengthen the quality, capability, and evidence base of the provision within these settings, including ensuring that specialist pedagogy, therapeutic approaches and partnership working are grounded in the best available research. We want all children and young people to have access to a curriculum that supports their aspirations and raises standards, including children and young people with more complex needs, who should be supported to access as much of the curriculum as possible. Therefore, working with experts, we will conduct a review of good curriculum practice in special schools, with a view to spreading best practice and improving standards.

Case study 9: Co-located specialist support West Thames College in London has built an exceptionally inclusive environment for young people with SEND. In 2017, it collaborated with Ambitious about Autism, welcoming Ambitious College as a co-located specialist provider. This partnership enables 48 students with autism to access bespoke programmes while benefiting from mainstream opportunities at West Thames. The collaboration allows students to gain access to a broader curriculum than standalone specialist settings could offer, develop social and life skills, and participate fully in college life. Their most recent Ofsted report highlights that learners with SEND receive excellent support from staff, including opportunities to develop their independence, such as through working in the second-hand shop based in the college. As a result, learners with SEND achieve well and most take part in a range of meaningful, individualised work experience placements. Spreading high-quality practice across the sector will not only improve outcomes for the children and young people directly served by it but will also enhance the reach, robustness and potential impact of specialist expertise across the wider system. Just as specialist settings have much to offer their mainstream partners, they also have much to learn from them. For instance, we know specialist Post-16 Institutions often work closely with FE colleges, individually and through Natspec’s work as a national Centre for Excellence which is funded by government to share expertise from within the specialist college sector with mainstream FE and skills providers. Collaborations mean college staff can access specialist CPD and exchange effective practice, while students can benefit from another college’s facilities, experience smoother transitions including to adulthood and independence, and have improved access to specialist health input. Overall, a more coherent and inclusive system should foster a culture of shared improvement and mutual learning, where insight and innovation move in all directions across the continuum.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_70", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "In future, we will therefore expect all special schools, alternative provision (AP) and special post-16 institutions to: provide high quality support and specialist education for children and young people with the most complex needs work in partnership with LA Commissioners to ensure parental engagement and the ongoing appropriateness of the placement for the child or young person act as catalysts for improvement by sharing expertise, coaching colleagues and contributing to joint professional development across the local authority area strengthen the overall system by demonstrating how education, health and care can work together around the needs of the child or young person provide outreach and short-time placements for some children and young people enrolled in mainstream settings.

A significant number of ISSs (over 30% of the settings, providing over 40% of the placements within the ISS sector) are owned by private equity firms, with considerable overlap with providers of children’s social care placements96.  Placements in the ISS sector are almost entirely state-funded and far more expensive than in state special schools (average unit costs per year in ISS are £62k vs £24k in state special), and we are concerned about evidence of some unreasonably high fees and the involvement of private companies seeking to make excessive profits97.  To address this, we will bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity to ensure LAs can pay a reasonable price for placements in ISS. To ensure equity for all and effective use of public money we will ensure flexibility in the approach according to different levels of need. We expect, after a period of engagement and evidence gathering, that the average fee LAs will be able to pay will be lower in cash terms from 2028-29.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_74", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "To ensure the role played by such settings is effective, we will also legislate to bring the duties and oversight of ISSs into line with other special schools by: Creating a statutory definition and, via a separate consultation, standards for ISS Aligning their admission duties with that of other specialist settings Requiring them to offer placements based on Specialist Provision Packages and in accordance with national funding bands, and adhere to the code of practice Increasing the financial transparency of the sector by requiring ISS to report on costs to the commissioning local authorities Giving the Secretary of State the power to refuse the expansion or opening of new ISS where there is limited evidence of demand from commissioning LAs.

With more children and young people identified as having additional needs, it is increasingly likely that some children in every class, and in every school, will have particular kinds of commonly occurring need. Planning to meet these needs ahead of time, and funding on the basis that that will be needed, on a cohort basis, means that funding - and children's needs - don't have to wait for individual assessments, or for needs to escalate to a certain point before being met.

Currently, the schools NFF allocates [£2.9 billion - 5.8%] through the low prior attainment and [£5.6 billion - 11.0%]100 deprivation formula factors, which is used as a proxy for SEND need in mainstream settings. Funding from these factors as well as the basic amounts for all pupils are combined into an identifiable “notional SEND” funding allocation – over £5 billion in 2026 to27. The 16-19 funding formula similarly allocates part of the funding using low prior attainment and disadvantage measured using student postcodes in order to get more funding to those providers whose students have greater needs. The way the SEND system is currently funded has led to a greater reliance on ‘top-up’ funding in mainstream settings, with support increasingly bespoke to individual pupils. Local authorities can spend their high needs budget on support in mainstream schools, but this support is inconsistent and declining101. Increasingly, settings have applied for extra funding (known as ‘top-up’ funding) to support children with commonly occurring needs. This ‘top-up’ funding for mainstream schools, which is tied to an EHCP, has risen and is rising much faster than core funding102, meaning a larger share of funding is tied to statutory assessments, which is delaying support and diverting staff time into bureaucracy. Schools need to plan effective and high-quality provision that invests in the teaching and support for the whole cohort of children with similar needs, and securing this funding is more effective through the core budget rather individual funding packages. Over time, we aim to move to ‘re-balance’ funding, directing more funding into core budgets for schools and colleges, while maintaining strong support for those with the most complex needs. Settings can be better equipped for meeting a wider range of commonly occurring needs, enabled by a funding route that allows for more proactive planning of the support their pupils may require and allows them to deliver tailored support more flexibly. With greater certainty about levels and sources of funding, settings will be able to decide on the best way to meet needs from within their core offer, including teaching strategies first and foremost, and incentivising earlier action that reduces escalation of need.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_78", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "We plan to do this by directing a portion of the high needs budget into the core budgets of schools and colleges. At the moment, this money is currently allocated to education settings through EHCP ‘top-ups’, but in future, more of it will go straight into schools’ and colleges’ core budgets so they can respond to children and young people’s needs more quickly and flexibly. Early years settings will also receive more of this funding upfront through local authorities.

Building on the approach taken in some local authorities (LAs), we will consult on ways to allow LAs to pass more of their high needs funding directly to local mainstream schools and thus increase schools' notional SEN budgets.

The funding that settings receive will be used to deliver the universal offer and ‘targeted’ or ‘targeted plus’, in line with new duties to plan for the needs of their overall cohort. Alongside this, mainstream settings will continue to receive high needs funding from local authorities which covers the costs of delivery of a Specialist Provision Package for those with the most complex needs, including through specialist bases. We will review how best to target this rebalanced SEND funding to schools and colleges to best target need. As more funding flows to schools and colleges through mainstream funding, rather than the High Needs funding system, we will seek to improve the allocation.

Inclusive Mainstream Fund In advance of re-balancing funding and to boost mainstream provision in advance of the reforms, we will provide £1.6 billion in additional funding over 3 years to supplement the existing core funding for SEND, with over £500 million per year over the next 3 years going to mainstream schools, early years, and post-16 settings. This will support settings in investing in a more inclusive mainstream system and build confidence that children and young people receive the right support as early as possible, as set out in Giving Every Child the Best Start in Life, in advance of statutory reforms. We expect settings to start using this inclusion funding now to build a core offer for children and young people with SEND, and going forward, use this funding to help identify commonly occurring needs and take meaningful steps to improve everyday teaching and support. Settings will also be able to spend the funding on developing more targeted evidence-based support offers, such as transition support or specific group interventions for those that need them, without formal assessments or diagnoses. Many settings are already leading the way with this approach under the current system, and we want to build on their successes, allowing more settings to do the same.

We intend for these Inclusion Strategy Reports to allow for greater oversight and accountability, including from Governors, in how schools are driving up the quality and breadth of their inclusion offer and help Ofsted assess the extent to which inclusion is implemented and embedded effectively across a school and in alignment with local partnership plans. The Inclusion Strategy will also play a role in peer support, scrutiny and review, boosting transparency, and accountability. DfE will work with the sector, Ofsted and parents to ensure they are achieving this aim, and to develop a peer review process to promote learning and improvements on inclusion.

Partnership leaders are ambitious and innovative, using shared data systems and regular quality assurance to identify needs, shape provision, and address gaps across education, health and social care. A culture of mutual respect and constructive challenge also underpins the partnership, ensuring that new services are designed collaboratively with education, health, social care and the Parent Carer Forum. Due to need not being evenly or predictably distributed, and the higher costs associated with supporting less-common need, we propose in the long term all schools will be required to pool a minimum level of funding within a local SEND group for inclusion, to support needs fairly across a group of schools. This pooled funding will be used collectively to meet the needs of children with SEND including through sharing expertise, resourcing, staffing, support bases and commissioning of shared resources, such as specialist teachers. It also supports our long-term aim for all schools to be in trusts and fits with the accountability the new MAT inspection will bring.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_83", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Remove reference to long term aim for all schools to be in a MAT – to avoid suggestion that this is what it takes to lead Delete expect language We expect these groups may need to allocate exceptional funding from the inclusion share across their schools to account for uneven levels of need not captured by National funding formula allocations. This will mean children benefit from a greater pool of local expertise, and schools benefit from early intervention, timely access to additional support, as well as a more efficient and collaborative way to use resources based on local needs.  School groups can also be a positive forum for collaboration between schools, providing a structure for peer review, support, and challenge to improve inclusion across areas, as well as early intervention via cohort commissioning. Working collaboratively will help schools to set consistent standards and ensure that all schools contribute to, and have access to, shared resources to best support their cohort of children and young people.

Building on this wider investment, we are boosting the support available to children with SEND and their families through Best Start Family Hubs, committing more investment to the overall SEND system from the early years through to post-16 and, later in the year, we will consult on funding arrangements to empower early years settings to act as soon as needs emerge. This section explains how our SEND funding reforms will apply in the early years. The current funding system creates significant barriers for early years settings. Multiple funding streams, such as SEN Inclusion Funding (SENIF), the Disability Access Fund (DAF), and support for children with more complex needs, operate with different rules and vary across local areas. This complexity makes it difficult for parents and providers to understand what support is available, and accessing funding is often administratively burdensome. Providers also lack clear guidance on the most effective interventions and how to track impact, which leads to variation and inconsistent support. As a result, families experience an uneven system where settings play a vital role in identifying additional needs but are hindered by bureaucratic processes that delay timely help and frustrate providers. The early years sector is highly localised, with thousands of small private, voluntary, and independent providers, including childminders, operating alongside maintained nursery schools and school-based nurseries. While many providers play a vital role in supporting inclusion, some are more reluctant to take children with additional needs, which creates gaps in access.

As outlined in the above funding reform section, more upfront funding to education settings will therefore also mean that they will be held accountable for how they spend these funds to develop and implement a high-quality universal offer. As recommended by the Institute of Public Policy Research109, inclusion will sit at the heart of our accountability plans. Clear accountability will extend beyond education settings and into broader partnership work across services, so that children get the support they need wherever they are. All layers of support from universal through to specialist will come with corresponding accountability for children’s outcomes and experiences across early years, schools and colleges, and redress mechanisms where the system does not work as it should. Accountability for individual support We will bring consistency to SEND provision by, for the first time, creating clear statutory duties for schools (including maintained nursery schools and school-based nurseries) and colleges to ensure every child and young person receives timely, high-quality and effective support. We will also consider, through future consultation, how equivalent duties could be extended to private, voluntary and independent early years providers. The Children and Families Act 2014 is key to ensuring that special educational provision is made for children and young people with identified SEND.

We will introduce new requirements that settings use the national standards of evidence-based interventions to plan appropriate support for their cohorts. For children receiving targeted or specialist support their nursery, school or college will have a legal duty to produce a digital Individual Support Plan (ISP).  Through the introduction of ISPs, settings will be accountable and responsible for delivering educational provision and supporting the child or young person to learn rather than this being the responsibility of the local authority (LA). This change seeks to address the concern that educational provision is often determined by people who have never met the child rather than professionals working with them everyday in partnership with their parents. This will also allow settings more flexibility to respond quickly and to update plans in response to children’s changing needs, rather than the current bureaucratic process.

We will set a requirement for ISPs to be reviewed regularly and discussed with parents and young people, and the use and quality of ISPs will be assessed through Ofsted’s inspections and assessment of SEND provision at a setting level. Education setting accountability We want every child’s education to be academically challenging, rich in opportunity and built on strong relationships. To support schools to better understand and monitor the experiences of children in more consistent way, a new Pupil Engagement Framework will be launched in summer 2026. This will be informed by insights from children, parents and carers, school leaders, and experts, and will highlight a range of good practice examples. It will allow schools to measure factors such as school belonging and safety, inclusion and relationships with teachers and peers, and how much children and young people value school. Many schools already do this well and we will learn from initiatives such as BeWell to provide more consistent support to schools, ensuring all are measuring their pupils’ engagement by the end of the Parliament.

For most pupils this is the right approach, but for the 15% of pupils in the system who do not fill all 8 slots within Attainment 8/Progress 8, at present, they are more likely to show as attaining below than their peers within the same prior attainment group 110. Any progress these children make is 111not as well recognised, and this results in not enough attention being given to whether the children entered for fewer than 8 qualifications are making the progress that they should, and some children being entered for qualifications they will not succeed in. We will therefore consult on a new performance measure, in addition to Progress 8, focused on the progress made by pupils who enter secondary school behind their peers to better recognise schools which are successful in enabling and supporting the progress of all pupils.112 This will ensure every child has their achievements recognised at the end of secondary school.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_91", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Under their new framework, for the first time, Ofsted now assesses all settings for inclusion. This evaluates how leaders set high expectations for all children and young people, including those with SEND, and put the right support in place to meet their needs. We will work with Ofsted to ensure that settings operating high-quality Specialist and Support Bases, and specialist provision in mainstream settings, are recognised and celebrated, while also being held to account for delivering inclusive provision. Under the reformed system, we expect every secondary school to have an inclusion base, with an equivalent number of places in local primary schools, building on and strengthening the inclusive support already in place.

Strengthening the scrutiny of complaints data We also heard that the time between Ofsted inspections is a concern for parents who have complaints about a setting’s SEND provision for their child, and we will therefore explore options for strengthening independent scrutiny over school complaints data and identify patterns that might show a setting is not meeting its responsibilities. We will consider options to bring together parents, experts in resolution, as well as practitioner experts in education, health and care to recognise areas where numbers of upheld complaints are unusually high and how patterns might initiate further interrogation of practice. We will explore how this process could support leaders and settings where complaints are coordinated and settings are struggling to resolve a single issue with parents. As set out in the Schools White Paper, we will also improve engagement between schools and families through establishing minimum expectations that supports the creation of meaningful home-to-school partnerships, with clear principles on what families can expect from schools, and what schools will expect of families in return.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_99", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "DELETE We also propose the formation of a group at local level, potentially as a sub-group of local partnership boards, to bring together Parent Carer Forums, SENDIASS, schools, and others.

In addition, parents and young people can continue to seek resolution via mediation or through appealing to the SEND Tribunal or Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman at particular points in the process. We will also seek to strengthen LA-commissioned but independent mediation services for decisions about specialist provision. We will work with key mediation bodies to embed professional standards for mediation providers, and with the Council for Disabled Children (CDC) and local authorities to promote new guidance and share best practice. Parents and young people don’t have to take part in mediation, but they will need to consider it before appealing to the SEND Tribunal about an EHCP, including prior to placement appeals. LAs will continue to provide support to families, which we will strengthen with additional funding for parent carer forums and SEND Information, Advice and Support Services (SENDIASS), so that they can provide families with high quality, easily accessible and independent information and guidance to help them navigate the new system and to build parents trust in the system (see Annex B for further detail). We expect the vast majority of disagreements to be resolved via these routes. We will continue to ensure there is a backstop where mediation does not resolve disputes. If parents still have a complaint about a LA’s decision not to carry out a needs assessment, they will be able to appeal to the SEND Tribunal for a ruling, in the same way as happens now. We will strengthen the needs assessment process so it is clearer, simpler, and reflects the voice of parents/carers and the child or young person.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_100", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "The Tribunal will also hear appeals against LA decisions about whether a child meets the new threshold for specialist provision (Figure 11). Parents and young people will be able to appeal to the Tribunal against a decision that the child or young person has not met the threshold for one of the new Specialist Provision Packages, and therefore an EHCP. Similarly, parents and young people will be able to appeal against a LA decision that a child no longer needs the support set out in a Package and that an EHCP should cease. Parents and young people will also be able to appeal for a decision from the tribunal if they believe that the Package identified for the child or young person would not provide sufficient or suitable support and that they should have a different Package.

The LA is better placed than the Tribunal (which operates nationally) to take decisions that take account of their local context and fair use of local resources. After retaking the decision, the LA would need to write to the parents or young person explaining how it had considered the Tribunal’s judgment. If the LA subsequently decided to name a different setting in the EHCP, the parents or young person could appeal against this decision in the usual way. If the LA decided to name the same setting again, the parents or young person would be able to re-appeal against this decision if they had new evidence and at least 6 months had passed.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_101", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Information about a child or young person’s special educational needs (SEN) or special educational provision (SEP) will be included in Package or placement appeals as appropriate rather than being separate.

For example, the LA will need to consider the child or young person’s SEN when deciding whether he or she meets the threshold for a Package, so a child’s SEN is likely to form part of the parent or young person’s evidence when appealing about this decision to the Tribunal. Similarly, information about a child or young person’s SEN or SEP is expected to form part of the evidence for a placement appeal as appropriate. At present, the great majority of appeals relating to SEN or SEP are combined with an appeal about the child or young person’s placement114.

Children, teachers, educators and parents will start to see real improvements. Crucially, unlike past attempts to reform the SEND system, we are investing before introducing new requirements, so that mainstream nurseries, schools and colleges are prepared and supported to make changes.

Parents know children’s needs and experiences better than anyone, and their partnership is essential to the success of these reforms. We recognise their confidence in the system has been eroded over time. Rebuilding trust is fundamental. By investing early, setting clear expectations, and continuing to listen to children, young people and families, we will ensure that reforms are grounded in the lived experiences of those they are designed to support. Through the National Conversation on SEND—the largest engagement of its kind—we have already heard from thousands of parents, practitioners and professionals, and we will continue this dialogue as implementation progresses. Across the country, there are many excellent nurseries, schools and colleges that provide inclusive, evidence based support. Some of these examples are included throughout this document, but there are many more demonstrating what is possible when the system works well. Our reforms build on what works—high quality teaching, early identification, strong relationships with families, and quality teaching, early identification, strong relationships with families, and welltrained professionals.

Annex D: Summary of proposed areas of development Introduction to the five areas of development This section describes five core areas that support learning: Executive function Motor and physical Sensory development Social and emotional Speech, language and communication Children and young people use these areas in different combinations to help them take part, engage and learn in every phase and type of education.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_118", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "They give us a shared language structure for: universal provision which is underpinned by an inclusive approach to curriculum design targeted adjustments and interventions specialist assessment and provision Using the same terms at the universal offer, and across Targeted, Targeted Plus and Specialist layers of support helps to ensure that: we take more a consistent approach by using the areas of development to identify where children need extra help, to plan that help, and to deliver it through interventions teachers, teaching assistants, leaders and  other education and heath professionals share the same understanding and language children can move more smoothly between levels of support, without being seen through different or conflicting models of need. The five areas are interconnected: progress or difficulty in one area can influence outcomes in others. For example, developing communication can strengthen social and emotional development. Progress may be uneven over time, and development in each area can go forward, pause or feel uncertain. This is normal. All humans have a unique and dynamic profile across these areas. For some children environmental and contextual factors may introduce temporary barriers to learning that can be fully addressed through timely identification and action.  For some pupils on-going factors, such as a disability, mean long-term support and adaptation is required. Teachers and leaders should remain curious about children experiencing barriers to learning and have proactive processes for noticing and responding to them and reviewing effectiveness. Research shows that the early years and first years of primary school are a sensitive phase for developing these skills. For example, many four-year olds will still be learning to focus and sustain their attention. These skills continue to grow over time. Building strong foundations in the early years matters, and children keep developing and consolidating them throughout their education and into adult life. Below, we provide a short summary definition for each area for quick reference.", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_119", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Executive Function Summary: Children use executive functions to organise their thinking, behaviour and emotions. These skills can be strengthened through well-designed teaching and routines. Executive functions are the mental processes that help us: focus attention hold and use information in our mind manage impulses plan and organise what we do next Executive functions help children to make goal-directed decisions and take an active part in learning. As these skills develop, children depend less on automatic reflexes and simple habits, and more on thoughtful, flexible decision-making. These capacities develop throughout childhood and adolescence, shaped by experience, environment and relationships. Understanding the core components of executive functioning helps teachers choose approaches that better support children’s learning and make their teaching more effective. Motor and Physical Children think and learn through their bodies. Motor skills underpin learning as thinking and conceptual development are rooted in perception and action. Motor or physical development spans: gross motor: posture, balance, whole-body control and large movements fine motor: precise hand and finger movements how these elements interact to produce purposeful movement Motor skills involve the planning, control and coordination of the body’s muscles to perform tasks—from early functional movement patterns to more refined, goal-directed actions. This includes developing and consolidating fundamental movement skills such as rolling, reaching, grasping, sitting balance and coordinated weight transfer, as well as the refinement of gross and fine motor control. Knowing about these components helps teachers understand how motor skills can impact on learning. This knowledge enables teachers to identify barriers to children’s learning which can arise, to avoid conflating motivation with motor/postural limits, and to help children to overcome those barriers with thoughtful adaptions. Sensory Children experience and make sense of the world through their senses. Every child’s sensory profile is unique across five external and three internal senses: External: vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell. These deal with sensations from the outside of our body", "doc": "SEND Consultation"}, {"id": "SEND Consultation_120", "section": "Part one: supporting every child and young person to succeed", "text": "Internal: proprioception, interoception and the vestibular sense. These deal with sensory information received from inside the body They combine to shape how children explore, engage and learn. Sensory processing is dynamic, not fixed. The way a child responds to sensory input can fluctuate with context, wellbeing and emotion. Health issues such as glue ear can affect the senses, and some children and young people will have long-term sensory disabilities, for example vision impairment or deafness that require ongoing special equipment and teaching. Knowing about these components can help teachers to create an environment invites curiosity, comfort and calm, supporting participation, creativity and concentration. Social and Emotional Children participate in the life of the school as social beings and learning is mostly shaped by social contexts, although it is not exclusively social. Children also have emotional responses to the expectations the learning environment places upon them, and their mental wellbeing is integral to these experiences. Social and emotional development includes how children: understand and manage emotions, form relationships, and navigate social situations and learning at school regulate emotions, identify and express feelings, and social cognition, such as recognising that others think and feel differently recognise social rights and responsibilities, such as valuing dignity, respect, and safety; and understand each person’s role in upholding them Understanding these components helps teachers to create productive learning environments that promote social and emotional development and support wellbeing. Wellbeing underpins engagement and learning; recognising its role helps the teacher to be curious about the reasons behind a child's behaviour, to notice patterns and respond to underlying social and emotional needs. Speech, Language and Communication Children make sense of the world and connect with others through speech, language and communication. Each aspect of communication works together to form foundation skills for learning and social development.

When Ofsted inspects early years providers, schools and colleges, it’ll do ‘deep dives’ on plans to make sure children are getting the right support. Ofsted will take its lead from the requirements of equalities law and the SEND code of practice – which together parents and campaigners have said for over a decade represent the right framework for mainstream support, if they were properly upheld within the education system. They require schools and colleges and early years settings to make reasonable adjustments to things like behaviour policies to accommodate neurodivergent children, and to provide adaptations to the curriculum or classroom teaching to make it accessible to children with SEND. For the first time, we will bring these requirements together in the National Inclusion Standards and create clear statutory guidance to ensure every child and young person receives timely, high-quality and effective support.

And they have to allow parents to appeal decisions to an appeals panel, which we will be strengthening in the case of SEND complaints to include an independent SEND expert. As a last resort, complaints can be escalated to the DfE, and the Department can compel the school to retake its decisions if they do not comply with its own policies and the law.

Around half of the £1.8 billion we are investing in Experts at Hand will go towards mobilising the incredible expertise of the existing specialist sector to support and upskill teachers in mainstream. This might range from expert training for teachers working in inclusion bases, through to short placements for children and staff within specialist settings. It’s important to remember that inclusion bases don’t require more staff over and above our existing projections, as the number of children in the school system is not changing.

The new mainstream inclusion fund, worth over £500 million per year for the next three years, will fund the staff time required to create and deliver mainstream plans. Over time, we expect to be able to provide an even greater proportion of overall SEND funding directly to mainstream schools and colleges, as we move from the vicious cycle of late intervention and spiralling needs of the current system to a virtuous cycle of early intervention in the new system.

One of the key points we’re consulting on is whether and how we should build further assurances into this part of the system. But what if a future government just chooses to underfund this mainstream support. You’ve radically reduced most children’s statutory entitlement, with no guarantees about what will happen to funding after 2030? That won’t be able to happen. We are building strong safeguards at every level of the system, with new statutory requirements on mainstream schools, councils and ICBs for the standards of early, expert support that is provided within the new system.

We’re refocusing them on children with complex needs – that we can’t expect the mainstream school system to routinely meet without bringing together a wider package of support around those children. In simple terms, children and young people will get an EHCP if they need more support than they can get routinely in mainstream school through Experts at Hand. They might need more intensive, daily access to physiotherapy; constant access to communication devices as a result of mobility or motor issues; or support from a qualified Teacher of the Deaf or Teacher of the Visually Impaired. EHCPs will cover specialist support in both mainstream and special schools, and children on an EHCP will be assigned a broad package of support – similar in a way to clinical pathways – called Specialist Provision Packages. Specialist packages will be developed with panels of education and health experts, taking on board views of parents. They will set out packages of support that groups of children with particular, complex needs like severe learning difficulties require. EHCPs will act as the legal confirmation of which package a child will access, what support they need from it, and other key things like the setting that will offer them a place. All schools and colleges – mainstream and specialist – will maintain an Individual Support Plan detailing the day-to-day educational support needs a child has and how they will be supported, so that can be updated easily between settings and with families. Individual Support Plans will be required in law, and will draw from the best practice approach set out within the Package. We will consider, through future consultation, how an equivalent duty could be extended to private, voluntary and independent early years providers.

A decade from now in 2035, as far out as we can reasonably expect, we still expect around 600,000 children to have EHCPs. Will there still be a legal right to an EHCP? Yes. Families will have the right to apply for an EHCP and there will be new legal duties on schools and colleges to meet the needs of children and young people with SEND routinely and early, without needing to wait on a diagnosis or full EHCP needs assessment. In the rare circumstances parents aren’t happy with decisions about EHCPs, they will still be able to appeal a LA decision on whether to assess a child for specialist support and the assessment result to the tribunal. But let’s be clear: legal rights in the current system are barely worth the paper they’re written on. Parents can wait years for EHCP assessments and plans, only to then have to go to tribunal to fight for assessments to be overturned and the provision to be put in place. This is about moving from a system built on adversary and bureaucracy to one that works first time, without a fight. You’re glossing over the issues – you’re taking away parental preference, weakening appeals…? I reject that. We’re solving some of the very real issues with EHCPs in the current system that through our engagement parents have told us about time again. Current EHCPs are hugely bureaucratic, slow, inflexible -- and worst of all often aren’t the end of the battle as parents still have to fight to get the support they specify. The development of new EHCPs will be a genuinely collaborative process. Once a child has been confirmed as needing Specialist Provision Package and an EHCP, the contents will be created in partnership with parents and children, grounded in a system that is newly resourced and equipped to deliver the support children need.", "doc": "SEND Comms Lines"}, {"id": "SEND Comms Lines_21", "section": "EHCPs", "text": "As part of that, you’re right that we will remove the option for parents to request a school that is outside the scope of the Package their child has been matched to. I firmly believe this is the right balance between each parent and child’s individual rights, and the need for us as the state to invest the resources we have fairly and wisely. And on appeals, we are again simply making the system quicker and more responsive, to better focus on meeting children’s needs rather than fighting battles. As is the case now, parents will be able to appeal both the decision to assess for an EHCP and the decision whether or not to grant one. What exactly is the new threshold for an EHCP? Under the new system, a child will be assessed to see if they need the support set out in one of the Specialist Provision Packages – which is support over and above what the mainstream school system can routinely provide through Experts at Hand. If they do need this support, this will then be set out in an EHCP. Packages will be designed by a panel of experts, and - because I am a politician not an educational psychologist - it is right that we allow time for them to be developed robustly and comprehensively over the course of this year. So, I’m not going to be able to sit here with you proscribing exactly where each individual child will fit in a future system that we are describing the principles, rather than the detail of, today. But I absolutely can give you a sense of what this looks like. For a physical disability, being a wheelchair user without any other impediments to learning wouldn’t be ‘complex’ – because our £3 billion funding for specialist places in mainstream will mean that schools have the resources to adapt their spaces to accommodate a wheelchair.", "doc": "SEND Comms Lines"}, {"id": "SEND Comms Lines_22", "section": "EHCPs", "text": "But needing regular support with eating and drinking during the school day would qualify. For a condition like autism, if a child is able to cope well and progress against the mainstream curriculum with adjustments like quieter spaces at break times and some additional small group language interventions, their support needs probably wouldn’t be ‘complex’. Whereas if their autism is accompanied by a learning disability meaning they will never be able to engage with the majority of the mainstream curriculum, it probably would. You’re putting parents who have already been through hell, through three years of anxiety about whether they’ll keep their EHCP? I strongly dispute that. The protections we have built in are substantial, to make sure nobody loses effective support currently in place. Children will stay in the current EHCP system until the reforms are implemented through legislation in 2029 – and only then will they start moving on to mainstream support plans or new EHCPs at the end of their phase of education. Every child who currently has an EHCP and is in year 3 or above will keep it until the end of secondary.

And for all those who need more support than the mainstream system can provide through Specialists at Hand, they’ll have a better, more flexible combined ISP and EHCP. What do any proposed changes do for the departmental projection of the number of people in receipt of an EHCP in 2035? If we made no changes to the system, EHCPs would continue growing exponentially – because families have no other way to access support in an overstretched and adversarial system. That is why we are rebuilding the school system to be inclusive from the ground up – recognising that 1 in 3 children will have some form of SEND over their lifetime. Where children’s needs can be met routinely by a better resourced and equipped mainstream education system, we make no bones about it – we want and expect that to happen without an EHCP. We are being totally up front: we know it is hard to envisage a system that works this way, wrapping support around children early, without a fight, in their local mainstream school. But all the evidence from our school system historically and from other countries today, tells us it is possible to build a mainstream system that supports children and helps them build the confidence and resilience to live well as adults. In time, we are confident many will see the new system as an improvement and chose themselves to make the switch.

So how do the percentage changes map on to children losing EHCPs each year? I reject the idea anyone is losing anything. From 2030, fewer children will need a new EHCP, and some children on EHCPs will get the best support by transitioning on to an ISP. In our new system, the vast majority of children and families who would have had to fight tooth and nail for support will instead have it provided routinely and early in their local school. Issues won’t escalate, and they won’t need an EHCP – they’ll have an ISP instead, providing a more flexible set of support based around clear national standards. And it’s also right that from 2030, once our new system is fully up and running, we begin to move children on to ISPs, knowing that the old-style EHCP is no longer needed to continue accessing effective support.

The government’s landmark Schools White Paper, to be published tomorrow (Monday 23 Feb) will chart a path to halving the gap between outcomes for poorer children and their peers, headlined by generational reform to the SEND system.

This is not the sign of a system delivering high standards for every child. To tackle these stubborn gaps, government will radically reform the way disadvantage funding is given to schools. Using household income rather than the binary indicator of whether a child receives free school meals or not, funding will be determined by a stepped model that will mean greater levels of investment for schools supporting the poorest children.

We're moving from a one-size-fits-all approach to education that understands and supports every child – keeping what works and changing what doesn't. The current SEND system is failing children and families. Under 40% of children with SEND achieve grade 4+ in English and maths GCSE. High needs spending has risen 86% in six years without meaningful improvement in outcomes or reduced waiting times. Nearly half of local authorities face effective bankruptcy. Without reform, SEND costs could account for 40% of total school funding by 2035 – with around 12% of children requiring an EHCP or alternative provision. Too many families are forced to fight for support through an adversarial system that arrives late, inconsistently, and only after exhausting battles. Teachers and specialists spend more time on paperwork than supporting children directly. The increasing reliance on EHCPs as the only route to support has shifted the system away from early intervention, meaning needs escalate rather than being met.

This is the biggest investment in SEND support this country has ever seen. It includes £1.8 billion so every community has specialists on hand, £1.6 billion going directly to schools for early intervention, £200 million to train every teacher, and £3.5 billion in additional high needs funding on top of Autumn Budget.

No more postcode lottery. Same high standards everywhere. Q: What support is available at each layer?

Primary schools will receive around 40 days. And high needs funding continues for children requiring specialist provision. We're putting the money where it's needed most. Q: Will some children be forced out of specialist provision into mainstream? A: Absolutely not. Let me be crystal clear - no child will lose their existing special school placement. Special schools remain for every child who needs one. What we're doing is building a system where more children can thrive in their local community if that's right for them, while protecting specialist provision for those who need it. This is about expanding choice, not limiting it. Q: Why should parents trust this when the current system has failed them? A: I understand the anger and exhaustion. That's exactly why we're building the system first and legislating second. Parents will see results before anything changes for their child. No changes to existing EHCPs before 2030. The right to apply for specialist provision stays. The Children's Commissioner gets new oversight powers. SEND specialists join school complaints panels.

No. What we're scrapping is the fight for support. EHCPs will continue for children with the most complex needs. But because of our reforms, most children will get the right support earlier, in their local school, without having to fight for it. Q: So what exactly is an EHCP going to look like in the new system? A: We're refocusing EHCPs on children with specialist needs that require a wider package of support. Children get an EHCP if they need more than mainstream schools can routinely provide through our £1.8 billion Experts at Hand programme. That might mean daily physiotherapy, communication devices, or support from a specialist teacher for deaf or visually impaired children. Every child will be matched to a  Specialist Provision Package- an expert-designed package of support – and the EHCP will set out the specifics of the provision of they require. EHCPs will act as the legal confirmation of which Package a child has been matched to, what support they need from it, and other key things like the setting that will offer them a place. Q: So you're raising the bar for support? What exactly is the threshold for an EHCP? A: We're building a system that clears the bar first time. Children get an EHCP if they need more than mainstream schools can routinely provide through our new Experts at Hand programme. We're refocusing EHCPs on children with complex needs who require a wider package of support.

But I can give you a sense of what this will look like. For autism, for example, if a child copes well with adjustments like quieter spaces and small group work, that's likely to mean they can get targeted support in mainstream. But if their specific needs mean they can't engage with the mainstream curriculum, that's probably going to need a specialist package of support.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_8", "section": "EHCPs", "text": "Q: Doesn’t this undermine the complexity of children’s different needs?

What we’ve seen over the last few years, is that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work. It doesn’t take into account the different levels of need and support that children require. That’s what we’re fixing. EHCPs will draw on Specialist Provision Packages to set out a new standard for the support children receive, setting them up for the very best outcomes later in life, and go alongside the Individual Support Plan maintained by the nursery, school or college that can stay flexible and responsive to children’s developing needs. And Individual Support Plans will be digital record of children’s needs and the support being provided, accessible to teachers and parents, and reviewed regularly as children’s needs change. Q: What happens to children who already have an EHCP? A: Children will stay in the current EHCP system until the reforms are implemented through legislation in 2029 – and then they will keep their plan and provision until they finish their current phase of education, whether that be primary, secondary, or post-16. The earliest any child currently in Year 3 or above would transition is when they finish primary school.

That's the transformation we're investing £4 billion to deliver. Q: So there will be fewer children with EHCPs? A: If we do nothing, EHCPs will keep rising exponentially – because right now, families have no other way to get support without an exhausting, years-long fight. Let's be honest about what \"losing an EHCP\" actually means in the current system. It means losing months of waiting, tribunals, paperwork battles, and the toll that takes on families. What replaces it is the support itself – delivered earlier, locally, without the fight. We know it's hard to imagine a system that actually wraps support around children without parents having to battle for it. But the evidence – from here and abroad – shows it's possible. By 2035, instead of continuing to rise, we expect roughly the same proportion of EHCPs as today – around 5.5%. That’s not a target. That's what happens when a system finally works – getting children the right support early, without a fight. If pushed on how many EHCPs that is: \nRoughly 450,000 in 2035 – the same as we see today.

It's to ensure children get the right support, at the right time, without their families having to fight for it. Q: So, won’t children in year 6 and year 11 face the most disruption? A: You’re right that the first cohort of children and young people to transition will be those in year 6, year 11 and post-16 in 2029/30. But by setting clear transitions that naturally align with education phases, we’re limiting disruption so that no pupil faces a cliff-edge in support or a sudden change mid-way through their education. It’s a triple lock of transitional protections: Every child who has a special school place in September 2029 will be able to stay in special school until they end school at 16 or 18, as is appropriate for them. Transition will only begin in 2029 once the new inclusive mainstream system has been fully built, and only then as children naturally move between phases like primary to secondary. Children who need an ISP rather than EHCP in the new system will get one before they transition out of their EHCP.

Individual Support Plans will be digital record of children’s needs and the support being provided, accessible to teachers and parents, and reviewed regularly as children’s needs change. Under our new system, all children with an EHCP will be reviewed by their school and local authority to see what the best support offer is for them – for some, it will be a new style EHCP and specialist support package and for others it will be an ISP.

Current EHCPs are slow, bureaucratic, inflexible, and even when you finally get one, you still have to fight to get the support it promises. That's not choice.

A: If the Tribunal finds against the LA, it would be able to quash the original decision and order the LA to reconsider.

One family gets excellent help. Another gets left to battle for years. That's not fair. That's not right. And it's not good enough. Packages mean consistency. They mean quality. They mean every child with complex needs gets support based on evidence. Q: Can you give me an example of what's in a package? A: For a child with severe learning difficulties, a package might specify daily physiotherapy, access to communication devices, support from a qualified Teacher of the Deaf or Visually Impaired, an adapted curriculum, and specialist teaching approaches.

Children under five with profound needs get fast-tracked directly to specialist assessment. No waiting. Q: So you’re placing this burden on schools to decide which children should be assessed? A: No, that's not what we're doing. Schools won't be deciding alone. For the first time, we're creating National Inclusion Standards, developed by an independent expert panel drawing on the best evidence. These standards guide teachers on identifying needs and choosing the right support, ending the postcode lottery. Crucially, these same standards also set the threshold for specialist provision.

A: We're completely overhauling how we hold schools to account for inclusion. For the first time ever, Ofsted is grading schools specifically on their inclusive practice. Schools that fail children with SEND can now fail their inspection. We're also introducing clear statutory duties requiring schools to identify and meet needs early – not wait for a diagnosis or an EHCP. Every school will publish an Inclusion Strategy showing exactly how they're supporting children with additional needs, and the Children's Commissioner will have expanded powers to scrutinise whether the system is truly working for children. Q: What about councils? Other services? They are providing these services – who is holding them to account? A: We’ve heard loud and clear that clear accountability is essential in rebuilding trust in the system. One of the key points we’re consulting on is whether and how we should build further assurances into this part of the system. Ofsted and CQC will develop a new Local Area SEND Inspection Framework, looking at how councils, health services and schools work together. Local authorities and Integrated Care Boards will have clear, joint responsibilities for planning and delivering support – and they'll be held accountable for outcomes. Where local areas are failing, the Department will step in with support, and if necessary, use intervention powers to install new leadership. Over the next few years, there is also substantial ICB and Local Government reform taking place. Over this time, the government will further strengthen accountability for local area partners to improve outcomes for families and children and young people with SEND. Assessments will be quicker and easier, with local authorities responsible for quality services and no incentive to block specialist provision and EHCPs, as central government will cover costs.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_19", "section": "Accountability and redress", "text": "Q: What role will Ofsted play? A: The bottom line is that if a school isn't delivering for children with SEND, that will now be reflected in their inspection outcome. Ofsted inspectors have received significant additional training on inclusion. They'll be doing deep dives into how schools are implementing their Inclusion Strategies and whether children are genuinely getting the support they need. We're also working with Ofsted on thematic reviews of inclusion bases to spread best practice. Q: But come on – Ofsted grading inclusion, national standards, new complaints processes – this is just more bureaucracy, isn't it? More box-ticking while kids slip through the cracks? A: No – this is the opposite of bureaucracy. Right now, parents spend years fighting through an adversarial system just to get basic support. Our reforms mean schools have clear duties, proper funding, and they'll be held to account by Ofsted for the first time on inclusion. Schools can now fail their inspection if they're not supporting children with SEND. The Children's Commissioner will have expanded powers to scrutinise whether the system is actually working. And if a school still doesn't deliver, complaints go to an independent panel with a SEND expert – and ultimately to my department. That's real accountability, not box-ticking. Q: Where does statutory obligation fall? A: Legal duties will be strengthened and clarified – meaning clear duties, proper funding and real accountability: Schools: New statutory duties to meet needs of children with SEND routinely and early, without waiting for diagnosis or EHCP. Local authorities: Key role in monitoring providers, ensuring effective use of inclusion funding, and strategic planning. Health (ICBs): Joint responsibility with LAs for multi-agency support offers All settings: Required to develop inclusion strategies based on new National Inclusion Standards.

No. I'm going after a system where councils often have to pay very high fees for provision, far beyond what is charged by state special schools Let me give you the numbers. A placement in an independent special school costs £632,000 a year on average. A state special school £264,000. Local authorities can end up paying nearly three times the price for the same child.  Not for those with more complex needs – a much higher price simply by making an independent placement rather than a maintained placement, and there's no evidence outcomes are better. Over 30% of these schools are owned by private equity. That's public money – taxpayer’s hard-earned money - money meant for vulnerable children that is flowing into private profit. That has to change. Every pound we claw back from excessive fees is a pound we can spend on specialists in mainstream schools, on teacher training, on building new places. That's what this is about - making sure children actually benefit from the investment. Do you accept independent special schools will close and children will lose places as a result of your price bands? I will not buy into scaremongering from private equity and vested interests to stop me acting in the best interests of children. Of course we will monitor the introduction of price bands carefully to avoid any unintended consequences, and work with the sector between now and implementation to manage the change. And while there is a huge amount of brilliant practice in the specialist sector, we have seen too many examples of councils being forced into paying eye-watering fees simply because they have no alternative – and despite provision sometimes being at best unproven and at worst actively unhelpful in preparing children for life and work.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_22", "section": "ISS", "text": "In setting our price bands we will engage closely with experts and the sector to make sure we are paying a fair price that encourages innovation and expertise to meet the high national standards that we will be setting through our new specialist provision packages. Are you saying every independent special school is bad? How will you distinguish between the bad and the good? No. We know that many independent special schools provide great support to children with SEND, particularly those with the most complex needs. This is about bringing consistency across the system so that every child no matter what schools they are in,  has access to the right support when they need it. Places are often determined based on EHCPs, does this confirm you are scrapping them? No – children who need the support of a Specialist Provision Packages, those with the most complex needs, will have EHCPs which will include relevant support from the Package. But in future a childs placement will be determined by which schools deliver the Package they need, not the contents of the EHCP. Is there any flexibility in the bands. What if a child’s needs become more complex over time and they need to move up a band? Funding bands will be based on the provision offers we expect to be delivered.  We will keep them under review, to ensure the provision reflects the latest evidence and the resources allocated enable the  school, college or setting to deliver them. If a child or young person’s needs change, their EHC plan would need to be reviewed.  This might result in a change in the provision offer. But these schools exist because councils can't provide enough places. Aren't you just attacking providers who stepped in where the state failed?

Some children with SEND rely on these schools but here you are attacking them? We are not attacking them, we are simply trying to ensure councils pay a fair price for all placements and  better outcomes for all children by increasing financial transparency and consistency across the system. We know these schools have a vital role to play and they will continue to do so. Unfortunately, we know that for some children in these schools are not getting the right support in line with the fees being charged and that needs to change. So how many of these schools are going to close? I'm not in the business of closing schools. I'm in the business of making sure children get excellent support at a fair price to the taxpayer. Any school that meets the  new standards and charges fair rates will continue. If some providers decide they'd rather close, that's their choice. But I won't be lectured by private equity firms about what's best for children. You haven't done any modelling on closures though, have you? Independent special school finances can be very opaque given private equity ownership structures in many cases. The key point is that maintained special schools currently offer equally brilliant outcomes for children at around a third of the average price of independent special schools. Even accounting for different, specialist types of need that some independent special schools accommodate, there is clearly an inappropriate and unsustainable gap in cost between the two. Average placements in independent special schools cost £61,500 per year compared with £23,900 in the state-funded sector.

What specific changes are you making? We're bringing independent special schools into line with the rest of the system. That means: New national price bands which will apply to all settings who receive state funding to deliver Specialist Provision Packages, will end unjustified fee variation for the same provision, giving councils the confidence to challenge poor value placements.

This is to bring down costs and improve provision for parents. Independent Special Schools won’t be allowed to charge extra. We will be legislating to, amongst other things, require ISS to offer placements based on Specialist Provision Packages and in accordance with national funding bands to receive government funding.

What evidence to you have of ‘excessive profit-making' in the ISS sector? We know that not all ISS make an excessive profit, and profit-making is a part of a viable business model. Profit-making is acceptable, but profiteering is not. Isn’t this just going to impact smaller non-profit ISS providers? We recognise that some ISS are small providers and/or charities, and any new requirements will be proportionate and avoid placing unnecessary burdens on providers who wish to continue operating as an ISS under the new changes. However, placements in ISS are largely state funded, and the government and local authorities do not have the information they need to understand how provision is delivered or whether it represents value for money, nor to ensure children and young people  are in the most suitable setting for their needs. Improving oversight and transparency across all state-funded specialist provision is essential to creating a more consistent and financially sustainable system, while ensuring ISS continue to play an important role for children and young people with the most complex needs. Q: Why price cap not profit cap? A: What we’re focused on is making sure every school’s number one priority is delivering the best outcomes for children.

How will you pay for it? A: Let me be clear about what we inherited. Councils have built up  deficits under a broken system the last government created and refused to fix. We are providing grants to cover 90% of that debt. These grants are to pay for current deficits, they do not affect planned spending. We are providing grants for 90% of deficits up to the end of 2025-26. For the next two years while we build our new system, we will continue to take a appropriate approach We will require sustained and energetic action from local authorities to begin acting in accordance with our new system set out today, which will begin to bring costs under control through effective early intervention stopping needs from escalating. Q: Where is this funding coming from? Is this new money or redistributed DfE funding? A: This is money that has already been spent by LAs, and the effect of the grant is to transfer the financial responsibility for that historic spending from local to central government. DfE will be handling the transfer of the grant to LAs. No DfE budget, or other support for LAs, is being reduced in order to provide this grant Q: Are these reforms going to cut spending by £6bn to eradicate the 'black hole' identified by the OBR?

We're fundamentally reforming the system. By intervening earlier and more effectively, we stop children's needs escalating to crisis point. Over time, because children’s needs are not escalating to crisis point, we expect that costs will begin to level out at a sustainable rate, in the 2030s, as our reforms begin to have a real impact through earlier intervention and better life chances.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_28", "section": "Q&A: MONEY – OBR, SUSTAINABILITY, SCHOOL FUNDING", "text": "Q: Won’t you see a rush of EHCP applications before your changes come in? A: Our whole approach is about giving families something better – support that comes when they need it, flexibly, locally and without a fight. We're investing £4 billion over three years to build a genuinely inclusive mainstream system. When families see that working – teachers trained in every classroom, specialists on hand, dedicated funding for proven programmes – they won't need to battle for an EHCP. Q: Are you making savings through these proposals? A: In every single year of this parliament, spending increases. This isn’t about cuts – it’s about transforming children’s experiences and outcomes. What we do expect is that over time, because children’s needs are being met early rather than escalating to crisis, costs will level out at a sustainable rate in the 2030s. Q: So the OBR will show your reforms make no difference to costs? A: They will show a difference – but the savings we make from reforming the system are being reinvested in delivering better outcomes for children. We expect their modelling to show increased investment in inclusive mainstream and maintained spend per pupil with an EHCP. Thanks to our reforms, instead of costs continuing to grow, they will level out at a sustainable rate in the 2030s.

Q: So £1-2 billion to be cut from existing DfE budgets? A: No. DfE budgets are increasing by £3.5 billion as a down payment on central government spending. Further details at SR27. Q: But you've allocated the additional £3.5 billion that will come from wider government, so clearly the rest will come from DfE? A: Absolutely not.

A: An Individual Support Plan is a personal plan for every child who needs extra support. Every child with SEND will have one. That's 1.7 million children – one in five in the school system. It will be a legal requirement for settings to create one. It will set out the extra help they’ll get to succeed, matched against high national standards. It is a digital record that captures everything about a child's needs and the support they're receiving – in one place, easy to access, easy to update. Parents will be partners in this, not bystanders. They will help develop the plans, including identifying a child's barriers to learning, the specific support and adjustments needed, and the outcomes they're working towards. Crucially, it's a living document. Children's needs change as they grow and develop, and the ISP changes with them. It gets reviewed regularly with parents to make sure support is working – and adapted if it isn't. This is part of our landmark £4 billion investment to make every school truly inclusive and transform outcomes for children with SEND. Q: Why digital? A: Because right now, too many parents have to tell their child's story over and over again – to every new teacher, every new school, every new professional. Records are scattered across different systems, paperwork gets lost, and when a child moves from primary to secondary or school to college, they can fall through the gaps. This digital plan travels with the child. When they move settings, their new school already knows what works for them. No more starting from scratch. No more parents having to fight to get their child's needs recognised all over again. Q: How is this different from what schools do now? A: Many schools already keep records of children's needs – but there's no consistency. Every school does it differently, records are often on paper or spread across multiple systems, and there's no national standard for what should be included.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_31", "section": "Individual Support Plans", "text": "We're changing that. A national format, clear statutory requirements, backed by high National Inclusion Standards that guide teachers on evidence-based support.

Settings will have a legal duty to identify children's needs as early as possible, create an ISP, and monitor progress to ensure interventions are working. Ofsted will inspect how well schools are using ISPs as part of their assessment of SEND provision. And if parents aren't happy with their child's plan, they can use the strengthened complaints process – with independent SEND experts on appeal panels. This is the right support, when children need it, without a fight. Q: How is this different from an EHCP? A: This is about support first, then formalising it – not waiting to prove the crisis before you can get help. With Individual Support Plans, it starts with the right support, when it's needed, without a fight. Most children will get help quickly through a clear targeted offer that schools recognise, funded up front and built into normal practice – rather than being forced into a long, adversarial EHCP journey just to access basic support. For children with the most complex needs, EHCPs will be retained and improved. The ISP sits alongside the EHCP, staying flexible and responsive to children's developing needs. Q: This sounds like you're leaving children without guaranteed support? A: That's not true. Parents unhappy with their child's ISP can use the school complaints process, which we're strengthening with digital tracking and faster resolution.

It funds interventions like small group language support, where and when children need it, at the first signs of additional needs. To rebuild parents' confidence and make sure every child with SEND gets the support they deserve, this funding will enable schools to deliver support like NELI (Nuffield Early Language Intervention) and ELSEC (Early Language Support for Every Child) to strengthen language development and early communication skills – without requiring formal assessments or diagnoses. Q: What is Experts at Hand? A: We are putting specialist expertise into every mainstream school, with £1.8 billion for educational psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists. This will be available on demand for children who need a little extra help, whether or not they have an EHCP. When fully rolled out, an average secondary school gets 160 days of dedicated specialist time every year. A primary gets 40 days. No EHCP required, no postcode lottery – the same high standards wherever you live. This is transformational. Children will no longer need an EHCP to access support because it will be routinely available. Across the country, our funding recruits almost 2,000 core specialists and 5,700 support professionals. Q: How will the funding be split? Will early years benefit more than colleges for example? A: Funding be allocated based on local need where support will have the greatest impact. Local areas must consider need across early years, primary, secondary and post-16 settings when shaping their offer. Why are local areas being given the discretion to do things differently? Isn’t there a real risk this creates a postcode lottery in the support children receive? A: Local areas are being given flexibility because children's needs are not identical across the country. Families have been clear that support must reflect local circumstances. Our wider plan for giving every child the best start in life recognises that early intervention transforms life chances, ensuring every child gets the right support at the right time.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_34", "section": "Mainstream Support – Experts at Hand and Inclusive Mainstream Fund", "text": "Q: How will it actually work? Isn’t there already a shortage of staff? A: Schools have been very clear that they need earlier access to specialist advice, and this policy is designed to deliver exactly that by organising support in a more consistent and efficient way. The aim is not to pull staff out existing services but to make better use of the specialist workforce we already have and ensure they can help schools earlier on before needs escalate. Q: What reassurance can you give to families who feel services are already stretched? A: Families are right to say the system is under strain — and that’s exactly why we’re acting. Our plan focuses on getting support in earlier, because we know from the government’s best start in life work that early help ‘transforms life chances’ and stops problems escalating before children even reach school age. So, my reassurance is simple: we are fixing the system, so families don’t have to fight for help. By providing earlier, clearer, and more consistent support, we’re easing pressure on services and giving children the help they need before problems spiral. Q: How can you guarantee there will be enough ‘experts at hand’ to go round? Surely this isn’t enough funding? A: We know that some schools already have great mainstream provision and this will only help build on this. The programme is designed to build capacity over time and has learnt from our best programmes like ELSEC, setting up support across communities. Alongside this, we are also investing more than £40m to grow the educational psychologists and speech and language therapists workforce. This includes £26m to train at least 200 educational psychologists per year in 2026 and 2027 followed by further investment to train more from the three years that follow, and £15m to establish new speech and language therapist advanced practitioners to get more SaLTs working in educational settings and to upskill speech and language support workers.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_35", "section": "Mainstream Support – Experts at Hand and Inclusive Mainstream Fund", "text": "Q: None of this guarantees support will actually be provided – it all relies on schools behaving well? A: I understand why families find it hard to envisage a system that proactively wraps support around children, given the battles they've faced for years. But our investment is truly transformational – £4 billion over three years. We will have clear standards for how this support operates. Across the country, our funding recruits almost 2,000 core specialists and 5,700 support professionals. We've heard loud and clear that accountability is essential in rebuilding trust in the system. One of the key points we're consulting on is whether and how we should build further assurances into this part of the system. Q: What evidence supports the claim that specialist input improves early intervention or reduces need for statutory support later? Early intervention is one of the most effective ways to improve children’s outcomes, and the evidence clearly shows that specialist input delivered early can prevent needs from escalating. We also have strong independent evidence. For example, Early Language Support for Every Child (ELSEC), and Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI) an evidence‑based programme used in schools – has been shown to boost children’s oral language development by four months, and by seven months for children eligible for free school meals. That demonstrates that timely, specialist input can significantly accelerate progress and reduce the likelihood that children will require more intensive statutory support later on. Q: Why is this a better system? A: Because it flips the system from “prove the crisis” to “support first, then formalise.” Most children will get help quickly through a clear universal and targeted offer that schools recognise, funded up front and built into normal practice, rather than being forced into a long, adversarial EHCP journey just to access basic support. It will be better because it’s simpler, faster and more equitable: clearer approaches and expectations for settings; earlier identification and intervention; funding that follows need predictably; and EHCPs for the smaller group who require a legally enforceable specialist package.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_36", "section": "Mainstream Support – Experts at Hand and Inclusive Mainstream Fund", "text": "That reduces bureaucracy, improves consistency between areas, and puts time and resource back where it belongs: in classrooms and with families. Q: All this will just make the classroom experience worse for most children, as teachers’ time is taking up supporting children with SEND? A: The Experts at Hand model is designed to reduce pressure on teachers. It brings in more specialist support, focuses on earlier identification and whole setting strategies, and helps staff feel more confident in meeting needs. Evidence from the programmes behind this approach shows improvements in classroom environments, behaviour and staff confidence, which benefits all children not just those with SEND. Q: How are you going to make sure your new inclusion bases have the right expert staff? A: Around half of the £1.8 billion we are investing in Experts at Hand will go towards mobilising the incredible expertise of the existing specialist sector to support and upskill teachers in mainstream. This might range from expert training for teachers working in inclusion bases, through to short placements for children and staff within specialist settings. It’s important to remember that inclusion bases don’t require more staff over and above our existing projections, as the number of children in the school system is not changing. We are well on our way to recruiting the 6,500 more teachers we need in colleges, secondary and special schools.

Are they covered by the £500 million? Today we have announced over £200 million so every community’s Best Start Family Hub provides a dedicated SEND outreach and support offer. This is on top of the over £700 million already committed to Best Start Family Hubs and the Healthy Babies programme, in partnership with the Department for Health and Social Care - to make sure every local authority can deliver a Best Start Family Hub and put the core offer in place. Q: Why are Best Start Family Hubs needed? A: We know that too many children aren’t starting school ready to learn, which means they not able to achieve and thrive later in live. A huge part of that problem is because the support just isn’t there – with one in four families with children under five cannot access local children’s centres or Family Hubs, rising to one in three lower income families. And for families with children with SEND, the system is too fragmented and too hard to navigate, with children only receiving support once problems have escalated. Best Start Family Hubs will change this by providing a single, joined-up place where parents can get support with early development, behaviour, feeding and emerging SEND needs. For families under the greatest pressure, especially in disadvantaged communities, this is about rebuilding family services that have disappeared for too long and creating a system people can genuinely rely on. Ultimately, the hubs will help ensure children get the best start in life, reducing inequalities and improving long-term outcomes. Q: What will the SEND practitioners actually do? They will be a clear point of support for families, giving practical, hands-on advice about their child’s development.

They will also help run or link families into the new early support sessions in Hubs, such as toddler groups that support speech and language or specialist parent and baby groups. Q: What sorts of SEND-support services can families expect to see at the hubs? Families will see evidence-based programmes and sessions designed for children with additional needs, including focusing on early language, communication and development, and helping parents feel confident supporting their little ones. This might include sensory classes, child-focused speech and language sessions for toddlers, or specialist parent and baby groups tailored to families of children with emerging SEND needs.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_40", "section": "Q&A: DELIVERY AND WORKFORCE", "text": "Q: How will this actually be delivered? A: We're investing first, legislating second. We build the system, prove it works, then ask families to trust it. We're putting £1.6 billion directly into schools for early intervention, £1.8 billion for specialists in every community, training every single teacher. No child's EHCP changes before 2030. We're not asking parents to take a leap of faith – we're showing them results first. Q: Won’t this make classrooms worse for other children? A: The opposite. Evidence consistently shows that inclusive classrooms benefit every child – academically and socially. And let's be clear about what we're actually doing – training teachers properly, putting specialists in schools so teachers aren’t struggling alone, creating dedicated spaces for small group work. An average secondary will get 160 days of specialist support a year – that’s a full extra school year of expertise. This isn’t teachers doing more with less. This is proper investment in getting it right for everyone. Q: Will more children with extra needs be in mainstream classrooms? A: Even over a decade, our modelling shows a greater proportion of children in specialist settings than today. What changes is that children get help earlier, locally, before problems escalate. Children in inclusion bases get tailored support without disrupting mainstream classes. Special schools remain absolutely central for children who need them. Q: What changes ensure the system is ready? A: This is the biggest investment in SEND workforce capacity ever. Every teacher becomes a teacher of children with SEND – that's not an aspiration, it's becoming a requirement. We’re training 200 more educational psychologists a year, expanding speech therapy apprenticeships, putting a SEND practitioner in every Family Hub. Training starts September 2026 across the entire system from birth to 25. Q: How are you supporting staff?

Clear national standards so schools aren't reinventing the wheel. Q: What about workload – aren't you adding more for teachers? A: No. The current broken system creates workload – endless paperwork, tribunal preparation, fighting for resources. Our reforms reduce that burden. Earlier support means needs don't escalate. Digital plans replace fragmented records. Specialists take on assessment work. Funding follows the child without constant applications. We’re consulting specifically on managing workload during implementation. Q: Isn’t this just about cutting costs and EHCPs? A: Absolutely not. We're investing an additional £4 billion in reform funding plus £3.7 billion capital. SEND spending is going up, not down. What we're doing is making the system sustainable by intervening earlier.

This is backed by £3.7 billion to create 60,000 new specialist places, supporting building adaptations, equipment, sensory spaces, and accessibility improvements. Bases -  Q&A Q: What does mainstream inclusion actually mean? How will you increase capacity? A: It means most children educated in their local school, with flexible support that adapts as their needs change, without needing to battle for an EHCP. A child shouldn't have to travel miles from friends and family just to get an education. We're bringing the support to them. We're building capacity through: £3.7 billion capital investment to create 60,000 specialist places New inclusion bases in every secondary school and equivalent primaries – providing specialist teaching within mainstream settings Retrofitting schools with sensory spaces, breakout rooms, ramps and accessible facilities Bringing specialists into schools rather than making children travel to them Q: What's the difference between a support base and a specialist base? A: Both are types of inclusion base within mainstream schools, but they serve different levels of need. Support bases help children who need a bit more. Specialist bases support children with the most complex needs – but both keep children in their local school, close to friends and family.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_43", "section": "PLACES", "text": "Q: Will every school have to have an inclusion base? A: Every secondary school will have an inclusion base, with an equivalent number of places in local primary schools. For many settings with high-quality support already in place, this will be a continuation of best practice. For some, it will mean using existing provision differently. Where new places are needed, our £3.7 billion capital investment will support this – including by repurposing and improving existing space. Q: How will you make sure inclusion bases have the right expert staff? A: Around half of the £1.8 billion 'Experts at Hand' investment will mobilise expertise from the specialist sector to support and upskill teachers in mainstream – including expert training for staff working in inclusion bases, and short placements for children and staff within specialist settings. This sits alongside our £200 million SEND training programme for all teachers, and the recruitment of 6,500 more teachers across secondary, special schools and colleges. Q: What's the quality assurance for these bases? A: For the first time, we will publish national guidance setting out principles and standards of high-quality practice for inclusion bases. Ofsted's renewed inspection framework now assesses all settings for inclusion, and inspectors have received significant additional training. Settings operating high-quality bases will be recognised and celebrated, while being held to account. We will also commission Ofsted to undertake a thematic review of inclusion bases. Q: How will children access inclusion bases – will they be stuck in them all day? A: No. Inclusion bases are designed to keep children connected to mainstream education, not separate them. For some children, support will be flexible and time-limited – perhaps small group literacy work or access to a sensory space to reset. For others with more complex needs, it may mean an adapted curriculum with one-to-one support, while still being part of their local school community.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_44", "section": "PLACES", "text": "Children move between the base and mainstream classes as appropriate to their needs.

We're creating 60,000 new specialist places and ensuring that every secondary school has an inclusion base. The new terminology – replacing confusing terms like SEN unit, resourced provision, and pupil support unit – creates clarity for parents. Crucially, all bases will now be underpinned by evidence-based national guidance and quality assured through Ofsted inspection. Q: Who decides whether a child accesses a support base or specialist base? A: Support bases are commissioned by schools, clusters, or Multi-Academy Trusts for commonly occurring needs – decisions will be made locally with parents. Specialist bases are commissioned by local authorities for children with more complex needs, typically those with or being assessed for an EHCP. In both cases, Individual Support Plans will clearly set out the support being provided. Q: What happens if the inclusion base in my child's school isn't right for their needs? A: Schools must assess complaints against their own policies, which must comply with the law. Parents can appeal decisions to an appeals panel, which we are strengthening to include an independent SEND expert. As a last resort, complaints can be escalated to the DfE.

And a new progress measure (LPA) – to better capture the achievements of children who start secondary school significantly behind their peers. Facts and stats White working class children are: The single largest group among FSM-eligible children with the lowest outcomes Less likely to be \"school ready\" at reception – gaps open early and widen through school More likely to find the transition to secondary school difficult Higher levels of identified SEND Among the highest overall absence rates – missing 12% of sessions on average (more than four weeks a year) Much less likely to say they enjoy school Around three times more likely to be persistently absent if they have low engagement scores", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_46", "section": "Disadvantage funding", "text": "Q: Why do we need to reform disadvantage funding? A: Because the current system is failing the children who need it most. The disadvantage gap is as stark today as it was over a decade ago in 2014. Under 40% of poorer children achieve a pass in English and maths GCSEs, compared to over 70% of their peers. That's not the sign of a system delivering high standards for every child. The problem is that our current funding model treats most disadvantage the same. Too much of it uses a simple yes/no measure – whether a child gets free school meals – to allocate billions of pounds. But we know that children who have been disadvantaged for longer do worse at school, and the gap between the most persistently disadvantaged and their peers has remained stubbornly high – even in years when the overall gap was narrowing. The current method of allocating funding fails to address the scale and depth of the challenge. That's why we're taking radical action to cut the link between background and success. Q: What's wrong with using Free School Meals as the measure? A: Free School Meals eligibility tells us whether a family is below a threshold – but it doesn't tell us how far below, or for how long. A child whose family has been in deep poverty for several years attracts the same funding as one whose circumstances changed last year. The evidence is clear that attainment is worse on average for children who have been disadvantaged for a greater proportion of their time in school. High-achieving disadvantaged children at the end of primary are often outstripped by their lower-achieving but more advantaged classmates by the end of secondary. That tells us the system isn't working – and funding that doesn't reflect these realities can't fix the problem.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_47", "section": "Disadvantage funding", "text": "We also know that some families who are eligible don't claim free school meals, meaning their children's schools miss out on funding entirely. Our new approach will remove that barrier. Q: What will the new model look like? A: This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebalance how billions of deprivation funding flows to schools – making sure it goes where it's needed most. We're developing a stepped model that recognises that not all disadvantage is the same – and that the poorest children need the greatest support. Funding will be based on how low family income is and for how long it’s been at that level. The deeper and more entrenched the disadvantage, the more funding a school will receive to support that child. We're also considering whether to factor in where a child lives, recognising that place-based disadvantage compounds individual circumstances. Q: When will this be implemented? A: This is a major reform – the most significant change to disadvantage funding in a generation. We will consult on our proposals in Summer 2026, working with teachers, school leaders and families to get this right. We want to hear from the sector on how best to allocate funding and address the impact of entrenched disadvantage on children's life chances. Implementation will follow careful consultation and testing. Q: Will schools lose funding under this model? A: Our aim is to target funding where children's needs are greatest. More than 300 mainstream schools are already achieving the outcomes we want to see for all children – including schools with above-average disadvantage. We want to learn from what works and spread that success. We will work with the sector to ensure reforms raise standards across the board.

The pupil premium grant alone provides over £3 billion – increased by almost 5% for 2025-26. On top of that, 10.6% of the National Funding Formula (over £5 billion) is allocated through deprivation factors in 2025-26. That's significant investment, but it will only deliver results if it's reaching the children who need it most. Our reforms will make sure it does. Q: How will you make sure schools spend the funding effectively? A: Investment without accountability is just spending. That's why we're taking a two-pronged approach - raising the bar for all schools while targeting intensive support where outcomes for disadvantaged children are poorest. We will strengthen pupil premium strategy statements as planning tools, exploring digital capabilities to support evidence-based decision making and share best practice. Schools that need additional help will receive government-funded pupil premium strategy reviews, delivered by sector experts providing tailored advice on how to plan, implement and evaluate improvements.

A: When the generation of children born under this government finish secondary school, it is the ambition that all children are stretched to achieve higher standards and the disadvantage gap will be halved. This means raising the national average Attainment 8 score to 50 and reducing the average Attainment 8 gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged children from 15.4 points to 7.7 points. Q: What would achieving this target mean in practical terms? A: Achieving the target would mean that, on average, pupils secure grade 5 or above across their GCSEs. Disadvantaged pupils would gain roughly an extra full grade across eight GCSE subjects compared to today. This includes around 30,000 more disadvantaged pupils passing English and maths at grade 4 or above each year. Q: Will KS4 targets result in grade inflation? A: No. Ofqual, the independent regulator, is responsible for maintaining standards. Any rise in grades must reflect genuine improvements in attainment. GCSEs are not 'norm-referenced' with fixed grade distributions – more pupils can achieve higher grades if there is robust evidence that underlying attainment has improved. Q: What interim targets has the government set? A: By the end of this Parliament, the government aims for: 75% of 5-year-olds reaching a good level of development in the Early Years Foundation Stage;  90% of children meeting the expected standard in the Year 1 Phonics Screening Check; the highest proportion of children meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at KS2 since current assessments began; and stronger progress at KS4 for disadvantaged pupils and those starting secondary school below expected standards. The government also aims to reduce the overall absence rate from 7.15% to 5.85% (equivalent to 20 million more school days each year from 2028/29) and deliver 6,500 more expert teachers in secondary schools, special schools and FE colleges, targeted where need is greatest.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_50", "section": "Disadvantage target - Q&A", "text": "Regional missions Q: What are the two new regional missions announced in the White Paper? A: The government is launching Mission North East and Mission Coastal – two area-based challenges designed to directly tackle the poor performance of white working-class children and provide a blueprint for change nationally. The missions build on the revolutionary impact of the London Challenge in the early 2000s, which successfully transformed educational outcomes through place-based collaboration and targeted intervention. Q: Why have these specific regions been chosen? A: Some of the biggest educational challenges are concentrated in specific regions, particularly affecting white working-class children. These areas have stubbornly low outcomes, high absence rates, and children are less likely to arrive at school \"school ready.\" These regions have concentrated challenges including high absence rates, lower school readiness, and persistent underperformance. The coastal mission will focus on the south coast, targeting disadvantaged coastal communities with stubbornly low outcomes. Specific local authority areas will be confirmed as the programme develops in collaboration with local partners. Q: How will the missions work? A: We will bring together clusters of schools facing similar challenges, diagnose shared barriers to progress, and develop a clear strategy for sustained improvement based on evidence of what works. Partnership boards will draw in expertise from our best schools and trusts, alongside the wider public and voluntary sectors. This is about the whole community taking shared responsibility for change - and what we learn will provide a blueprint for transforming outcomes for disadvantaged pupils across the country. Q: White working-class pupils in the North East have better KS4 outcomes than in some other regions - so why focus there?

A: The government is consulting on a new best-fit progress measure, in addition to Progress 8, focused specifically on the progress made by children who do not meet the expected standard in English reading and maths at the end of KS2 – those with the Lowest Prior Attainment who start secondary schools significantly behind their peers. The measure is intended to shine a light on progress for pupils who start further behind. It will take into account their progress across English, maths, and between 1 and 6 other subjects. Q: Why is a new measure needed? A: The accountability system must promote high standards and good progress for those currently with the lowest levels of attainment and progress. This new supplementary measure will provide additional insight where Progress 8 alone may not fully reflect these pupil’s achievements. It would make progress for pupils with the lowest starting points more visible. All pupils will continue to be included within Progress 8, incentivising schools to be ambitious for their attainment across a broad curriculum. Q: Won’t this “best fit” progress measure lower aspirations for children with low prior attainment?  Is this an example of going soft on standards? A: Every child deserves the same high standards and expectations. Progress and attainment measures set an expectation that most children should enter at least 8 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications and for most children this is the right approach, We want to explore ways to support progress of the small group of pupils for whom it is not the right approach to enter for at least 8 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications, and to support schools to make decisions in the best interests of each pupil.

A: The current system can lead to children being entered for qualifications they will not succeed in, schools not being recognised for genuine progress with lower-attaining pupils, and insufficient focus on whether children entered for fewer than 8 qualifications are progressing appropriately. Q: Which children would this measure cover? A: The measure would focus on children who start secondary school significantly behind their peers. At KS4, pupils with low prior attainment includes those who did not meet the expected standard in both reading and maths at the end of key stage 2. They are more likely to be disadvantaged or have special educational needs. Q. Won’t this widen inequalities? Schools will just game the system A: Every child deserves the same high standards and expectations, and we want to support schools to make decisions in the best interest of each pupil. However, all pupils would still contribute to Progress 8 and Attainment 8 on the current basis and therefore there is still the incentive to enter any pupil who can succeed in eight qualifications and for schools to be ambitious for their attainment across a broad curriculum. Q: How does this fit with broader accountability reforms? A: The best fit progress measure sits within wider accountability reforms including improved Progress 8 to encourage broader curriculum entry, trust-level inspection for transparent quality oversight, a more intelligent and proportionate accountability system focused on improvement, and better recognition for schools achieving progress with all children.

This isn't warm words – it's action backed by investment. Q: What are you doing to keep teachers in the profession? A: We've already got the lowest teacher leaver rate in over a decade – 9%, the best since 2010 outside COVID. Now we're building on that. Almost 10% pay increase over two years. A new retention programme from Autumn 2026 sharing what actually works. Removing the ceiling on pay so heads can reward their best teachers. More flexible working in schools than ever before.

This represents real progress, improving national maternity pay for teachers for the first time in more than 25 years.

Brilliant teachers shouldn't have to choose between starting a family and staying in the classroom. Q: Is this enough? It still lags behind nurses and other public sector professions. A: It's an important first step, not the end of the journey. It builds on the wider action we've already taken – lowest leaver rate in over a decade, almost 10% pay rise over two years and £233 million in recruitment investment. If we want every child taught by expert teachers, we have to build a profession that works for the people in it. Q: What about teaching assistants and support staff? A: Teaching assistants are vital to our schools – they deserve proper recognition. They're included in our £200 million SEND training package. This government values all school support staff. That is why we're launching the School Support Staff Negotiating Body to give them a sector specific voice on pay and conditions for the first time. Support staff will get equivalent maternity pay improvements. We're also continuing research into how schools can deploy support staff most effectively. Q: How are you supporting headteachers and school leaders? A: Great headteachers set the culture where all children can achieve.

The Improving Education Together agreement with unions and employers means policy works in practice. We're collaborating on new training materials. We've got models like Greater Manchester Education Trust showing what embedded professional development delivers – outcomes above national average and improved retention. We're working with the Race Equality Unit on recruitment and progression of ethnic minority teachers. We're trialling anonymised profiles for teacher training candidates.

A: There is an existing programme of support and we will continue to fund Education Support to provide free professional supervision and counselling for school and college leaders until March 2027. Leaders can access this support by visiting  Education Support's website. We expect to launch a new programme, expanded with the additional funding announced in the white paper, during 2027 and will provide further details on that new programme in due course. ++++++++++++++++++++", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_59", "section": "GROUPINGS", "text": "Top Lines Schools should be at the heart of their communities.

Enabling every child to achieve and thrive cannot be achieved by individual schools acting alone. Standalone schools can face serious challenges - of the 55 academy trusts in cumulative deficit as of August 2023, 40 were single-school trusts. We will put collaboration at the heart of the system by moving to all schools joining or forming high-quality school trusts, including new trusts established by Local Authorities. High-quality trusts that are rooted in their communities can act as anchors - working with local partners, local government, and health services to support young people beyond the school gates. Analysis shows that becoming academies in strong trusts can transform previously underperforming schools. Schools that have been in MATs longer perform increasingly above the national average. 89% of primary schools report improvements in sharing skills and expertise after joining a trust, and 92% of secondary schools report the same. Groupings Q: What's the evidence this works? A: Analysis shows that becoming academies in strong trusts can transform previously underperforming schools. Converter academies in MATs perform increasingly above the national average for English and maths at KS4 the longer they have been with the MAT. Schools joining trusts report wide-ranging benefits: 89% of primary schools report improved sharing of skills and expertise, 82% report improved staff training. 92% of secondary schools report better sharing of expertise and 83% improved quality of school leadership. Q: How will trusts be rooted in their communities? A: Our best school trusts use their scale, governance and high-quality leadership to innovate and drive excellence in standards and inclusion. They bring to life a high-quality curriculum by sharing expertise and resources, deploy teachers where they are most needed, and optimise expenditure by sharing resources and implementing joint initiatives. The most effective trusts act as civic institutions that partner with schools, LAs, faith groups and wider public services.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_60", "section": "GROUPINGS", "text": "High-quality trusts must be rooted in their communities to play their part as civic institutions. We will expect all school trusts to look outwards with purpose, share expertise, and support others to improve. This includes embedding collaboration into the standards we require of trusts, with a pillar focused on community collaboration in the new Trust Standards. We will encourage trusts to report on how they have supported stronger outcomes in their community through annual public benefit reporting. Q: Isn't this just academisation by the back door - forcing schools into trusts whether they like it or not? A: We're not forcing anything - we're showing schools that collaboration works. 89% of primary schools report better skills sharing after joining a trust. 92% of secondaries say the same. We're making the case, not issuing mandates. The reality is that standalone schools are struggling. Of 55 trusts in deficit, 40 were single-school trusts. Q: You've just spent months attacking academies through the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill. Now you want every school to become one? That's a U-turn. A: We’ve always been clear that strong trusts will be at the heart of our system reforms. Through the Bill, we’ve levelled the playing field - national curriculum, teacher pay, core standards apply everywhere now. The question isn't academy versus maintained anymore. It's isolated versus connected. We want every school in a strong, community-rooted group. Local Authority MATs mean schools that work well with their council can keep doing so - inside the trust framework. Q.If you want all schools to join trusts why are you replacing the duty for inadequate schools to join a trust with a discretionary power? Removing the automatic duty to issue academy orders does not diminish the role of high quality trusts — it gives the Secretary of State the flexibility to use a greater range of tools to drive rapid improvement in schools which are struggling, while keeping structural intervention as the default position for the weakest schools. It also enables the Secretary of State to act where progress is slow or where schools face delays towards academisation, ensuring no school or child is left behind.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_61", "section": "GROUPINGS", "text": "Some underperforming schools have existing strong leadership which could improve the school with support. Where Ofsted has judged that a school has the capacity to improve, we will provide intensive support to drive that improvement without upheaval of structural change. The Regional Improvement for Standards and Excellence service will work alongside and support schools and their responsible bodies to drive improvements. Q: What about effective collaboration already happening under other structures? A: We recognise that there are school groupings across the system already facilitating excellent collaboration. Where quality is high, we want to deepen and grow that collaboration within the structure of a trust. To this end, we will remove the barriers to LAs establishing trusts and update co-operative academy school trust model articles of association, so more trusts can adopt a model which has proven itself effective and inclusive. Q: What's wrong with schools that are doing perfectly well on their own? A: Nothing - except they're keeping their excellence to themselves. Our challenge to great standalone schools is to partner with others, spread what works. The best headteachers know that sharing expertise benefits everyone - including their own staff and pupils. Q: How does a trust help a child learn to read? A: Better teachers, better training, better resources. Schools in trusts share specialist staff, pool CPD, deploy teachers where they're needed most. A struggling Year 1 class in one school can access the literacy lead from another. For a child in that class who needs extra help, it means a reading specialist when they need it.  Collaboration between schools and across local communities is key to improving outcomes for children and families. Q: How does this work with local authorities? A: Local authorities have a vital leadership role, using their statutory duties, democratic mandate and geographic reach to convene partners, secure school places, support SEND provision, manage admissions and transport, and improve attendance and behaviour. As more schools join strong trusts, effective partnership between trusts and local authorities becomes increasingly important to deliver shared outcomes.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_62", "section": "GROUPINGS", "text": "Q: What about small or single-school trusts? A: Our challenge to our best standalone schools is to partner with others through a school trust so they can spread their excellence more widely. Most MATs are currently small - we will work with the sector, prioritising quality over pace, to build a system where trusts are large enough to optimise benefits in terms of driving pupil progress, estates planning and financial resilience. Q: What are Local Authority MATs? A: We are creating the ability for school trusts to be established by Local Authorities so that schools are supported to deliver for all children. This will allow schools that work well with their local authority to continue to do so within the trust framework. LA MATs will deepen collaborative partnerships that have developed in the maintained sector by bringing them into the shared governance and accountability structure of a trust. Q: Why allow Local Authorities to establish trusts? A: Historically, LAs have not been able to set up trusts, which has been a barrier to some of the best maintained schools supporting other schools to succeed. High-performing maintained schools should be able to formalise their relationships and add expertise and capacity to the trust system. There is excellent school improvement work already being delivered through school companies and other forms of partnership - we want to see these grow and flourish through the school trust system. Q: Won't this create conflicts of interest? A: We will implement safeguards to manage potential conflicts of interest, both within the trust and the LA, including restrictions on the LA's involvement in the day-to-day running of the trust. These school trusts will be subject to the same regulatory framework as all other trusts. LAs will not be involved in the day-to-day running of trusts.

The scale of change that this policy entails varies by area. Government is setting out a clear vision for how the system should develop, alongside a commitment to work with all local partners to deliver it. Rapid, forced conversions risk creating under-prepared trusts. We will work in partnership with LAs, religious bodies, schools and trusts to build this system – considering the pace of change that is right for each area – and enabling better planning for capacity, sequencing and risk than has previously been possible. Q: How will trusts be held accountable? A: We will set demanding expectations for all school trusts through new Trust Standards. We will create these by overhauling the school trust quality descriptions to reflect the vision in this white paper - emphasising standards, inclusion, value for money and community collaboration. We will work closely with the sector and Ofsted on how new inspection arrangements will operate. Where standards are not met in an inspection, we will intervene. Q: How does this relate to school-level inspection? A: We recently announced trust inspection this will work alongside school level inspection to ensure all schools and trust are performing and appropriate steps and support is being taken where needed. Q: How does this help children with SEND? A: Schools working together is at the heart of SEND reform. Geographically coherent trusts mean better SEND planning, pooled funding, shared specialists. A child with complex needs shouldn't depend on whether their individual school can afford support. Trusts spread that responsibility - and that expertise. Q: will you introduce stronger MAT CEO pay regulations to help ensure equality across the system? We are tightening the academy trust handbook by requiring executive pay increases to be proportionate and justified, to prevent excessive increases for individuals carrying out broadly similar roles.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_64", "section": "GROUPINGS", "text": "We continue to tackle trusts on executive pay where there is insufficient demonstration of value for money. Where an academy trust is found to be an outlier compared with similar academy trusts, the Department will engage and assesses compliance. Q; Will there be funding to set this up? We are not setting out any funding for this in line with current process. The benefits, including financial, of joining a strong structure are well understood in the sector. This will mean that for most schools and trusts, the case for converting outweighs the costs. Q. How will the finances work for LA MATs? LA trusts will be subject to the same funding and regulatory framework as all other trusts.  A funding agreement will be in place between Secretary of State and the trust, and the Secretary of State will be accountable to Parliament. The model will feature safeguards to manage potential conflicts of interest, both within trusts and local authorities, including restrictions on the local authority’s involvement in the day-to-day running of a trust. Q. When will you share guidance and updated applications for LAs on creating trusts? We will set out the arrangements for applications alongside updated commissioning guidance in due course. As part of this, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to manage potential conflicts of interest, both within trusts and local authorities, including restrictions on the local authority’s involvement in the day-to-day running of a trust. Q. How will you ensure there isn’t a two tier system of strong and weak trusts? We will drive up quality across all trusts by setting clear and demanding standards, holding to account, recognising and celebrating where quality is high, and intervening when necessary.

In doing so, we will take account of scale, geographical coherence and capacity to meet local school improvement needs. Q. How will this impact faith schools? Area planning will provide a route for local partners, including religious bodies, to identify local priorities and develop the school trust landscape that is right for each area. We know that, for example, the Catholic Education Service and Church of England Dioceses' already have strategies for their schools, and we look forward to working in close partnership to bring planning to life. Q. What is a school doesn’t improve whilst in the new trust structure? We have been clear that in circumstances where a trust is failing, it may be appropriate for one or more of its schools to move to a new, high-quality and appropriate trust. Our reforms, including the legislation we have announced via the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill will enable this, through Trust Standards, trust inspection and intervention. Q.

This is only possible when behaviour standards are high and teachers can take a consistent, predictable approach. Every pupil deserves to learn in a safe, calm classroom and we will always support our hard-working and dedicated teachers to make this happen. Unfortunately, too many pupils do not feel safe at school and are missing out on learning. Our approach focuses on identifying problems early, addressing underlying causes, and preventing issues from escalating. Teachers, school leaders and families all play a vital role in helping us achieve this. When schools and families work together, attainment improves. The Education Endowment Foundation found that on average, parental engagement initiatives have a positive impact of 4 months additional progress on average over the course of a year for children in early years and primary. That’s why we are setting clear expectations for both schools and parents through meaningful home-school partnerships. Suspensions should be teachable moments, not dead ends. We are equipping schools with new tools to maintain discipline while minimising disruption to education, including guidance on internal suspensions and placing a new statutory duty on schools to provide schoolwork for excluded pupils. We are also taking action on unacceptable practices like offrolling by strengthening oversight of pupil movement, working with Ofsted to hold schools to account. This comes alongside plans to identify support needs earlier and strengthen training for teachers, which will reduce classroom disruption and maximise teaching time.

A: Too many children are losing out on learning because of disruption in classrooms. Teachers are losing seven minutes of every half hour to misbehaviour. Less than half of year 7 to 13 pupils feel safe at school every day. Last year we saw nearly a million suspensions – the highest on record. That's not acceptable. We're taking action. Q: What's actually causing this behaviour crisis? A: There's no single cause. Some children are struggling with unmet needs. Some have chaotic home lives. Some schools lack the tools to intervene early. What we know is that exclusion without support doesn't work – it just moves problems elsewhere. We need firm standards AND strong support. Internal Suspensions Q: What is the proposal? A: We’ve already confirmed a forthcoming consultation on a new national framework, allowing more pupils learn under supervision and stay engaged in their education, instead of being sent home where they have access to mobile phones and social media. Q: What are internal suspensions and how do they differ from isolation? A: Internal suspension is a time-limited, supervised intervention that allows a pupil to remain on the school site while suspended. Unlike isolation, which often removes pupils from learning without structured educational input, internal suspension ensures pupils continue to engage with learning during their sanction. This is also different from seclusion, which is a non-disciplinary safety measure. Q: So you're keeping disruptive kids in school instead of sending them home – isn't that rewarding bad behaviour? A: Absolutely not. High expectations are non-negotiable and bad behaviour disrupts other pupils’ learning. But when we send children home, too many end up unsupervised, disengaged, and falling further behind. Internal suspensions keep children on site, keep them supervised, and keep them learning. It's discipline with a purpose – reflection, not rejection.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_68", "section": "BEHAVIOUR", "text": "Q: Teachers already can't cope – now you want them to supervise naughty kids as well? A: This isn't about adding to teacher workload. Children will complete the work they would have missed, so teachers aren't left picking up the pieces later. They'll be in a supervised environment, receiving support to understand their behaviour. Schools like Olive Academy Thurrock cut suspensions by more than half while maintaining high standards. That's not going soft – that's getting smart. Q: Why should well-behaved children suffer because troublemakers stay in school? A: They shouldn't – and they won't. Internal suspensions remove disruptive pupils from the classroom. The difference is they stay on site, supervised, continuing their education. Every child benefits from calm classrooms. And children who are struggling get the support they need to turn things around. Q: Are you stopping headteachers from excluding violent pupils? A: No. Violence has no place in schools. We back headteachers to use permanent exclusion where they judge it necessary – including for physical assault or weapons. What we're changing is what happens before and after. Early support. Understanding root causes. And making sure excluded children don't just disappear from the system. Parental Engagement Q: What is the government doing to improve parental engagement in schools? A: We are establishing minimum expectations for home-school partnerships. Schools will be expected to communicate clearly, share progress updates, support home learning, and help with transitions. Parents will be expected to ensure attendance, reinforce good behaviour, and actively engage in their children's learning. We will also create a one-stop shop of age-appropriate support and advice for families. Q: What will schools be required to tell parents? A: Minimum expectations will cover effective and timely communication, including attendance data, behaviour information, curriculum details, academic progress, and upcoming events. Schools should use available technology to share up-to-date information and set out how families should engage effectively and respectfully.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_69", "section": "BEHAVIOUR", "text": "Q: Why is this the government's business – shouldn't parents just do more? A: When parents are engaged in their child's learning, children make four months extra progress every year. That's the evidence. But too many parents don't know what's expected, and too many schools only call home when something's gone wrong. We're resetting that relationship – clear expectations for schools AND for parents. Shared responsibility, shared success. Q: How will you actually make parents engage? A: We're making expectations crystal clear. Schools will communicate regularly, share progress, reach out with positive news – not just problems. Parents will ensure attendance, reinforce behaviour standards, and actively engage in their child's learning. When children are suspended, Reintegration Support Partnerships will bring schools and parents together to develop a joint plan. Q: What about parents who just don't care? A: The vast majority of parents want to support their children – they just don't always know how. Half of secondary schools don't give parents enough information on supporting learning at home. We're changing that. For the small minority who genuinely won't engage, schools will have clearer tools to escalate concerns and access support from local services. Q: Will this actually make any difference? A: The evidence is clear. Schools that combine high expectations with strong support see results. Dixons Cottingley Academy transformed behaviour through meaningful parental engagement. Olive Academies cut suspensions while improving outcomes. When we get this right, we recover learning time, keep children in school, and give teachers the calm classrooms they need. That's millions more minutes of teaching time. That's the prize. Duty to set work for excluded pupils Q: What is the new duty on schoolwork for excluded pupils? A: We will introduce a duty requiring schools to set schoolwork for for pupils who are suspended for five days or less, ensuring that exclusion does not mean an end to education.", "doc": "Media Briefing Pack"}, {"id": "Media Briefing Pack_70", "section": "BEHAVIOUR", "text": "Q: Why is this duty being introduced? A: Evidence shows that most pupils suspended for five days or fewer receive little meaningful work, leading to learning loss and disengagement, and current practice is inconsistent, with only around 30% of headteachers providing and marking work and fewer than onethird of pupils recalling receiving any. As 99% of suspensions fall within this short duration, where full-time education is not currently required, we will make the provision of work during these suspensions a statutory duty. Exclusion can be necessary in serious cases, but we must minimise the impact on a child's education. Setting work for excluded pupils ensures they can continue learning and reduces the time-consuming catch-up required when they return. It also supports better outcomes and smoother reintegration. Q: How will this work in practice without adding to teacher workload? A: Through consultation, we will ensure the guidance framework reflects current best practice while giving schools flexibility to adopt approaches suited to their local context. The aim is to support pupil learning while remaining mindful of staff workload. Many schools have already developed efficient approaches that support suspended pupils without creating additional burdens for staff. Examples include allowing pupils to join live lessons via platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Google Meet, enabling participation in real time, or using systems like Google Classroom to set and collect work in a way that is streamlined for both remote and in-school learners. Reintegration support partnerships Q: What are Reintegration Support Partnerships? A: We’re backing schools to work with parents to turn suspensions into teachable moments, not missed opportunities. Reintegration Support Partnerships will help schools and parents co-develop tailored plans that support pupils to re-engage, reduce repeat suspensions, and improve behaviour. This will include a formal meeting following a suspension that results in an agreed plan with clear roles and responsibilities, and is about resetting expectations, promoting shared responsibility, and making sure every child gets the support they need to thrive.

A: No child should be pushed out and forgotten. Off-rolling is unacceptable and where inspectors find evidence of this, it will be reflected in the school’s report card, and leadership and governance may be graded ‘urgent improvement’. We are also strengthening data‑sharing with Ofsted to support earlier identification of risks Q: How will you identify schools that may be offrolling pupils inappropriately? A: We are developing a new dashboard to monitor pupil movement at school level. We will use the dashboard alongside insight from Ofsted and regional teams, to conduct an annual review of how children move through the education system. This will help us monitor the use of off-site direction, managed moves and the reasons pupils leave a school, including identifying any evidence of off-rolling. Q: What accountability measures are in place? A: Schools can now fail Ofsted inspections and be placed under new management as a result of failings in their approach to inclusion. The new inspection framework assesses all settings for inclusion. We want every child to feel safe, supported and respected in school, and we will ensure schools are held accountable for inclusive practice. Links with SEND Q: How will these proposals impact children with SEND? A: Equality and inclusion are integral to these new approaches. We expect schools to monitor their impact to ensure pupils with unmet needs or significant challenges receive timely support. High standards, early support, and meaningful parental engagement are crucial for ensuring every pupil, including those with SEND, can learn and thrive in a safe, calm classroom.

Our ambition is to raise standards for all children and halve the disadvantage gap. This is a long-term ambition for the generation of children born under this government, and means on average, pupils will achieve a grade 5 or above across their GCSEs, and disadvantaged pupils will achieve the equivalent of one grade higher in each GCSE compared with today. We are also setting shorter-term targets for the end of this Parliament. It is our ambition that children’s outcomes at the end of primary school (KS2) will reach their highest level since current assessments began, and the attendance rate will rise to over 94% – the fastest improvement in a decade.", "doc": "Stakeholder Script"}, {"id": "Stakeholder Script_1", "section": "", "text": "Schools play an important role in communities, acting as anchors in children’s lives – this will be covered in the first chapter of the white paper. We will build on the progress already being made to rebuild public services and improve children’s lives, inside and outside school - across education, social care, health and youth services. Our plans will wrap adaptable and responsive services around children and families to actively support the healthy, happy childhoods children deserve and address the factors that can prevent children from achieving and thriving in school – by improving early family support, tackling child poverty and enabling greater collaboration across all local services.

Three layers of support: Universal support – for all children and young people: Inclusive teaching supported by national training for all early years, school and post-16 staff; early identification; and national expectations through National Inclusion Standards. Targeted support, including Targeted Plus – for children and young people who need more: Rapid additional help in mainstream settings; a new Individual Support Plan (ISP); and Experts at Hand – enabling specialist support such as educational psychologists and speech and language therapy available in every area.", "doc": "Stakeholder Script"}, {"id": "Stakeholder Script_4", "section": "", "text": "Specialist support – for children and young people with the most complex needs: Support through EHCPs where needed, based on the new nationally defined specialist provision packages outlining required interventions, resources, and standards.

This is a long-term programme of change. EHCPs will not change before September 2030, with transition to the new system phased up to 2035. Investment begins now so families feel improvements well before legislation changes take effect. EHCPs will be digitised, co-designed with teachers and carers, and will offer a guarantee for children and young people with complex needs.

Clear, consistent support through Specialist Provision Packages for those with complex needs: mainstream and specialist support will be delivered more reliably, with national standards and digitised EHCPs. There will be accountability at every level of the system: education settings, trusts, local authorities and national bodies will all have clearer responsibilities, strengthened Ofsted oversight and improved complaints processes, so you can be confident your child’s needs won’t be overlooked. Individual Support Plans in education settings will be underpinned by law. There will be support and stability during transition: no EHCP changes before 2030, and improvements are starting now so families feel benefits early. Those who require EHCPs will have routes to access them. Key messages for early years Early years is at the heart of early support: we understand the importance of early identification and intervention – we heard it time and time again through the national conversation. Early years staff will benefit from a new £200mil national SEND and inclusion training programme, which will give all staff across education settings the skills to identify needs earlier and create more inclusive classrooms. We understand the importance of expertise in the early years: we are putting new investment so every Best Start Family Hub will have a dedicated offer for children with additional needs and their families, and a SEND practitioner to offer direct support to children and families.", "doc": "Stakeholder Script"}, {"id": "Stakeholder Script_6", "section": "", "text": "We are facilitating partnerships between early years and mainstream settings to support smoother transitions. Key messages for post-16 We know that colleges are already highly inclusive. Smoother, more supportive transitions between stages of education: effective transitions for students with SEND require personalised, early planning that begins at least 12 months in advance. Schools and post-16 providers will be required to share information more efficiently so that support is ready from day. Digital tools, including Individual Support Plans, will help manage transitions between institutions and into employment. Best practice in transition planning will be embedded across all providers, with accountability for its delivery. New, improved EHCPs will guarantee statutory entitlements to provision from the Specialist Provision Packages. These will be delivered in both mainstream FE and Specialist Post-16 Institutions (SPIs) and will continue to age 25 for those who need longer to achieve their learning aims. More stable funding and greater autonomy: when the reforms are enacted, more provider funding will be directed through core budgets, with greater autonomy for providers to direct this to support all learners who require additional support. Key messages for SEND campaign groups Protecting legal rights for children and young people who need support: new, improved EHCPs will guarantee statutory entitlements to provision from the Specialist Provision Packages.

Specialist provision for those who need it most: Special schools will remain a vital part of the system, and for children and young people with the most complex needs, we are protecting access to high-quality special school placements so they continue to get the right support, in the right setting, when they need it.", "doc": "Stakeholder Script"}, {"id": "Stakeholder Script_7", "section": "", "text": "No immediate changes for children and young people in the system: No changes to EHCPs before 2030, when new Individual Support Plans and Specialist Provision Package will provide timely, appropriate support for all children and young people with SEND. Importantly, children and young people who currently attend a specialist setting will continue to attend those settings. Key messages for LAs Local Authorities as leaders in an efficient SEND system: Local authorities will lead a clearer, more consistent SEND system, driving high-quality Individual Support Plans, embedding new National Inclusion Standards and overseeing Specialist Provision Packages. This will help more children have their needs met in mainstream settings, slowing EHCP growth and easing long term pressure on high-needs budgets. Increased investment in specialist support for mainstream schools: £1.8bn investment into ‘Experts at Hand’ will give local authorities the tools to deliver rapid, joined-up specialist support into mainstream settings, helping children get the right support earlier without waiting for statutory processes. Improved SEND dispute process: We will strengthen mediation services, enabling local authorities to focus on what matters most – providing effective support for children with SEND and building trusting partnerships with families. Local authorities will help shape school collaborations: Local authorities will help shape school collaborations including groupings and pooled funding.
